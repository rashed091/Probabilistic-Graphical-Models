    "If we have an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$, this is called an unbiased estimator if $E[\\hat{\\theta}] - \\theta$ is zero (where $\\theta$ is the true quantity). For a stochastic approximation, if our estimator is unbiased, we get convergence guarentees under the somewhat mild conditions ([Robbins, Monro 1951](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/34dd/d8865569c2c32dec9bf7ffc817ff42faaa01.pdf)).\n",

    "If $E[\\hat{L}] \\neq L$, then clearly it is not necessarily true that $ \\frac{d}{d\\theta}E[\\hat{L}] \\neq \\frac{d}{d\\theta}L$. This means that for some arbitary loss function, if we perform an SGD like approximation many times over, our adjustments, based on the gradient, don't necessarily move us in the correct direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we view optimisation as moving us 'downhill' to some minimum point on our loss surface, if the gradient is a biased estimate, we do not have a general guarantee that this biased estimate will always point in the correct direction in expectation. For an unbiased estimate, we can view this as saying that whilst any single estimate will be wrong, if we take many estimates such as when we perform SGD, the resulting movement on the surface will likely be quite close to the true optimal move.\n",
