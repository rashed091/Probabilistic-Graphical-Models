    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent variable models allows us to explicitly model the latent structure of the task, which gives us explainability in addition to learning the relationships between events. However, since latent variables are not directly observed in the data, we need to use Expectation Maximazation (EM) algorithms to learn the relationships, and that is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectral learning** is using linear algebra to learn latent variable models. Its advantages are\n",
    "\n",
    "both theoretical...\n",
    "- Provably consistent\n",
    "- Deeper insight into identifiability\n",
    "\n",
    "and practical...\n",
    "- Local minima free\n",
    "- 10-100x speedup over EM\n",
    "- Model non-Gaussian continuous data using kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral learning's goal is to preserve the explanative properties and theoretical guarantees provided by latent variables, but avoid the computational cost that comes with latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that in most tasks, the solution to the task itself does not require any information about latent variables - it only exists for modeling purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as an example of a latent variable model. With latent variables, we can see that it is a computationally tractable to perform inference on HMMs since its maximum cliques are very small (size 2).\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem arises from marginalizing out the latent (white) variables in the diagram - in the graph, we seem to arrive at a clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if looking at a simple latent variable model with one hidden, and 3 observed states depending on that hidden state, we can see that there is a relationship between the number of hidden states for $H$ and the complexity of the relationship between the observed variables once $H$ is margnialized.\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "If we have 1 state, then the marginal distribution is equal to the conditional distribution of the observed variables on $H$, which means they're all independent. On the other hand if $H$ has $m^3$ states, where $m$ is the number of states for each observed variable, then the marginalization would have enough parameters to fully paramterize any relationship between the observed variables, and thus forming a clique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, there is also an intermediate case between these two extremes - how can we exploit this relationship between observed variables?\n",
