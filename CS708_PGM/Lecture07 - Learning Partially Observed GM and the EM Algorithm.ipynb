    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this previous lectures, we introduced the concept of learning Graphical Models from data, where *learning* is the process of estimating the parameters, and in some cases, the network structure from the data.\n",
    "Lecture 5 introduced this concept in the setting of *completely observed* GMs. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in the setting of fully observed nodes  and globally independent parameters for each conditional probability distribution is straightforward because the likelihood function can be fully decomposed as a product of independent terms, one for each conditional probability distribution in the network. This means that we can maximize each local likelihood function independently of the rest of the network, and then combine the solutions to get an MLE solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we turn our attention to **partially observed graphical models**, an equally important class of models including Hidden Markov Models and Gaussian Mixture Models. As we will see, in the presence of partially observed data, we lose important properties of the likelihood function: its unimodality, closed-form representation, and decomposition as a product of likelihoods for the different parameters. As a result the learning problem becomes substantially more complex, and we turn to the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to enable estimation of our model parameters.\n",

    "A GM $M$ describes a unique probability distribution $P$.  To learn partially observable GMs, we must iterate between inferring relationships described by $P$ and estimating a plausible model $M$ from data $D$. In this way *inference* can be considered a subroutine of the learning problem:\n",

    "+ **Exact inference algorithms.** Including the elimination algorithm, message-passing algorithm (sum-product, belief propagation), the junction tree algorithms. These algorithms can give the precise result of query. The major topic of this lecture is on exact inference algorithms.  \n",
    "+ **Approximate inference techniques.** Including stochastic simulation / sampling methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, variational algorithms. These algorithms only gives an approximate answer to the inference query. We will cover these methods in future lectures.\n",

For $P(z)$ to be a valid probability distribution, $0 \\leq \\pi_k \\leq 1$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^K \\pi_k =1$. We call $\\pi_k$ the *mixture proportion*.

    "**Hidden Markov Models** (HMMs) are one of the common ways of modeling time series data. It is used in traditional speech recognition systems, natural language processing, computational biology etc. HMMs allow us to deal with both observed and **hidden** events.

    "+ **Generalized (Incomplete) EM**: It might be hard to find the ML parameters in the M-step, even given the completed data. We can still make progress by doing an M-step that improves the likelihood a bit (e.g. gradient step). Recall the IRLS step in the mixture of experts model.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning the parameters of **partially observed graphical models**, or latent variable models, is considerably more difficult than for fully observed GMs. This is because the unobserved or latent variables tie the observed variables together via marginalization, and we can no longer decompose the maximum likelihood function into independent conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EM Algorithm** provides a way of maximizing the likelihood function for latent variable models. We can find the MLE parameters when the original problem can be broken into 2 steps: (1) Estimating or \"filling in\" the unobserved latent variables using the best guess (posterior) provided from our observed data and current parameters, and (2) updating the parameters based on this guess:\n",

We solve for $\\theta$ given current $q$ ignoring current $\\theta$, then solve for best $q$ given $\\theta$ ignoring the current $q$. \n",
