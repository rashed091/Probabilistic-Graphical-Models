    "## Introduction\n",
    "Last class, we presented two major types of graphical model task, **Inference** and **Learning**, and we mainly discussed about inference. In this lecture, we start to introduce the learning task, and explore some learning techniques used in **fully observable Bayesian Networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Graphical Models\n",
    "Before we get started, it's better for us to get some intuition about what learning is and which goal learning is achieving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "The goal: Given a set of independent samples (assignments of random variables), find the best (or the most likely) Bayesian Network (both DAG and CPDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure below, we are given a set of independent samples (assignments of binary random variables). Assume it's a DAG, we are going to learn the directed links (causality relationships) between nodes, this process is called **Structural Learning**. Learning the conditional possibility is another task called **Parameter learning**.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "As listed below, there're several learning scenarios we are interested in:\n",
    "1. Completely observed GMs:\n",
    "* 1.1. directed\n",
    "* 1.2. undirected\n",
    "2. Partially or unobserved GMs:\n",
    "* 1.1. directed\n",
    "* 1.2. undirected (an open research topic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful estimation principles are also listed here:\n",
    "1. Maximal likelihood estimation (MLE)\n",
    "2. Bayesian estimation\n",
    "3. Maximal conditional likelihood\n",
    "4. Maximal \"Margin\"\n",
    "5. Maximum entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **learning** as a name for the process of estimating the **parameters**, and in some cases, the **topology** of the network, from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are going to introduce **Parameter Learning**, and some useful related models.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing parameter learning, we assume that the Graphical model **G** itself is known and fixed, **G** could come from either expert design or an intermediate outcome of iterative structure learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of parameter learning is to estimate parameters from a dataset of $$N$$ independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training samples $D = \\{x_1, \\cdots, x_N\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each training case $$\\mathbf{x}_n = (x_{n,1}, \\cdots, x_{n, M})$$ is a vector of $$M$$ values, one per node. Depending on the model, elements in $$\\mathbf{x}_n$$ could be all known (no missing values, no hidden variables) if the model is completely observable, or partially known ($\\exists i, x_{n,i}$ is not observed) if the model is partially observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we mainly consider learning parameters for a **BN** that is **completely observable** with a given structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Family Distributions\n",
    "There are various density estimation tasks that can be viewed as single-node GMs (see the [supplementary section](#supplementary) for examples), and they are in fact instances of **Exponential Family Distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential Family Distributions are building blocks for general GMs, and have nice properties allowing us to easily do MLE and Bayesian estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "For a numeric random variable $X$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_X(x|\\eta) = h(x)\\exp\\{\\eta^T T(x) - A(\\eta)\\}=\\frac{1}{Z(\\eta)}h(x)\\exp\\{\\eta^T T(x)\\}$$\n",

    "Function $T(x)$ is a sufficient statistic (will be explained in [sufficiency section](#sufficiency)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Function $A(\\eta) = \\log{Z(\\eta)}$ is the log normalizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see lots of probability distributions actually belonging to this family (including Bernoulli, Multinomial, Gaussian, Poisson, Gamma).\n",

    "T(x) &= [x;vec(xx^T)] \\\\\n",
    "A(\\eta) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\mu^T\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu+\\log{|\\Sigma|}=-\\frac{1}{2}tr(\\eta_2\\eta_1\\eta_1^T)-\\frac{1}{2}\\log{(-2\\eta_2)} \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "After this conversion, we see that the Multivariate Gaussian Distribution indeed belongs to exponential family.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a $k$-dimension Multivariate Gaussian Distribution has a $k + k^2$-dimensional natural parameter (and sufficient statistic). However, as $$\\Sigma$$ has to be symmetric and PSD, parameters actually have a lower degree of freedom.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Properties of exponential family\n",
    "**Moment generating property**\n",
    "\n",
    "The $$q^{th}$$ derivative of exponential family gives the $$q^{th}$$ centered moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dA(\\eta)}{d\\eta} = mean$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2A(\\eta)}{d\\eta^2} = variance$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can take this advantage to compute moments of any exponential family distribution by taking the derivatives of the log normalizer $$A(\\eta)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: when the sufficient statistic is a stacked vector, partial derivatives need to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moment vs. canonical parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the moment generating property, the moment parameter $$\\mu$$ can be derived from the natural (canonical) parameter by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dA(\\eta)}{d\\eta} = \\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $$A(\\eta)$$ is convex since\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2A(\\eta)}{d\\eta^2} = Var[T(x)]>0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can invert the relationship and infer the canonical parameter from the moment parameter (1-to-1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\eta = \\psi(\\mu)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can say that a distribution in the exponential family can be parameterized not only by $$\\eta$$ - the canonical parameterization, but also by $$\\mu$$ - the moment parameterization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MLE for Exponential Family\n",
    "For i.i.d. data, we have the log-likelihood:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ell(\\eta;D) = \\log \\prod_nh(x_n)\\exp\\{\\eta^T T(x_n) - A(\\eta)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$=\\sum_n\\log h(x_n) + (\\eta^T\\sum_n T(x_n))-NA(\\eta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the derivatives and set to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial\\eta} = \\sum_n T(x_n)-N\\frac{\\partial A(\\eta)}{\\partial\\eta} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial A(\\eta)}{\\partial\\eta}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_n T(x_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\mu}_{MLE} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_n T(x_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This amounts to moment matching. Also, we could infer the canonical parameters using $$\\tilde{\\eta}_{MLE}=\\psi(\\tilde{\\mu}_{MLE})$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sufficiency\n",
    "We can see from above that for $$p(x|\\theta)$$, $$T(x)$$ is sufficient for $$\\theta$$ if there is no information in $$X$$ regarding $$\\theta$$ beyond that in $$T(x)$$. Then, We can throw away $$X$$ for the purpose of inference w.r.t $$\\theta$$. These could be shown by both Bayesian view and Frequentist view.\n",

    "#### Pros\n",
    "This method gives us the parameters that \"best fit\", or maximizes the likelihood of seeing the training data. Therefore for the test data, intuitively it should be at least close to the truth. MLE tends to give good performance in the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "We just show that the parameters for calculation of probability upon seeing a test data depend on the frequency of seeing the same pattern in the training time. This leads to a problem. If there's a test data case that's never seen in the training data, then we will auto assign a zero probability to that test data, which is \"infinitely wrong\" because it will lead to a infinity cross entropy from real world to our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also shows the overfitting problem, that we fit our training data too well that we cannot generalize our model to the real world well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example on the slide\n",
    "$$b_{F4}=0$$ because there's no casino roll such that $$x=4$$ and $$y=F$$ in the training data. However we all know this is not true!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocounts\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can add \"hallucinated counts\" to all the cases, so that even the cases which are never seen in the training time will get some counts. Therefore at test time there will be no zero probability assigned to any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How many Pseudocounts do we add\n",
    "Imagine if the total frequency of the cases in training is 100, and we add 10000 counts to one case, then that case will be assigned a very high probability in the test time. What we just have done is equal to saying that \"I strongly believe this will happen\". In another word, we put lots of belief in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we just add one Pseudocount to each case, then the probability of frequent cases will decrease, but not too much. Their rankings in probability won't change, because it's just their denominators in MLE calculation have changed, by the same amount. The spared probability will be distributed to cases never seen in the training. They will be very small, but this eliminates the problem of zero probability in testing. This is what we call smoothing.\n",
