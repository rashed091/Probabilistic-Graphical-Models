    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Changing gears, we now introduce an alternative set of methods for approximate inference. These methods are based on on stochastic simulation/sampling from a target distribution. In many inference tasks (such as finding a marginal $P(x)$, computing the partition function $A(\\theta)$, or finding the expectation of an arbitrary function), we are interested in quantities that in a sense sum over the configurations of a true distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_p(f(x)) = \\int f(x)p(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    " In such problems, we may not have the true distribution in closed-form or this integral might be tough to carry out. However, if we are able to simply sample from this distribution, approximate inference is possible by using  a sample-based representation of $p(x)$. Here, the true distribution is now represented by the collection of $N$ samples that we draw and we can rephrase the problem as \n",
    "\n",
    " $$E_p(f(x)) = \\frac{\\sum f(x^n)}{N} $$\n",
    "\n",
    " This is in essence the spirit of Monte Carlo Methods, which give us a stochastic representation of a potentially complex distribution. This representation can then be used to compute the marginals and expectations that we care about. The good news is that these approximations are asymptotically exact (they get closer to the true $E[f(x)]$ as $N \\rightarrow \\infty)$ and are flexible for any distribution. However, there are key non-trivial challenges that must be overcome:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. How exactly do we draw from them from complex  distributions? \n",
    " 2. Not all samples are equally useful (more on this later).\n",
    " 3. How do we know we've drawn enough samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Sampling: A Naive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We first discuss a seemingly obvious solution for sampling in the case where we can easily sample from the joint distribution. Such a case is if we have a BN, which gives us a straightforward generative model for a set of RVs. To sample from a joint distribution, we can simply traverse a BN in topological order, constructing our sample by filling in values node by node. At each step, we use the CPDs as well as the previously filled-in values. We can run this process many times and then use frequency counts to perform any inference task, such as finding a conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we observe that we run into an issue when we deal with large models and want to consider rare events. In such cases our approximate inference estimates can easily be biased because as the sample size is too small. If we want to condition on such a rare event,  our frequency counts will give a very low-sample estimate. In the worst case, we may even have 0 examples for a particular rare event, falsely indicating that such events are impossible and also making it impossible to condition on such events. This can be extended in general to any case where we can sample from the joint easily. If we want inferences that involve conditionals, we will have to perform and keep track of an exceedingly large number of samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rejection Sampling\n",

    "* The **unnormalized distribution** $\\tilde{p}(x) = \\frac{1}{Z}p(x)$ is easy to evaluate. Note that this alone does not make $p(x)$ amenable to sampling.\n",
    "* The **proposal distribution** $q(x)$ is a distribution that we can easily sample from (e.g., uniform or normal).\n",
    "* $k$ is a chosen constant such that $kq(x) \\geq \\tilde{p}(x)$ for all $x$. This is called the **comparison function**.\n",

    "1. Sample $x_0$ from $q(x).$\n",
    "2. Sample a number $u_0$ from the uniform distribution over $[0,kq(x_0)]$. \n",
    "3. Reject the sample if $u_0 > \\tilde{p}(x_0)$ and retain the sample otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that steps 2 and 3 are akin to accepting the sample $x_0$ with probability $\\frac{\\tilde{p}(x_0)}{kq(x_0)}$.

    "Essentially, what importance sampling is trying to do is to weight the samples such that they reflect relative importance to each other. The hope is that even if regions where $P$ has high density are low probability regions in $Q$, the weighting on these samples will be high enough to offset the fact we won't see many samples in this region. Similar to the arguments against direct sampling, if $Q$ has really thin tails where $P$ has high probability (and where the means are going to actually be located around), we may simply never see enough samples from this region. We might need an extraordinary number of samples to offset this, meaning most of our samples are wasteful as they are very low importance. In terms of a sampling algorithm, this is compounded by the fact that usually the stopping condition is when the estimate for the mean of $f(x)$ starts to converge. However, in the scenario we described, its possible to have a stable estimate even if all the samples are coming from low probability regions of $P$.  Thus, the algorithm will stop even though the mean estimate is very inaccurate. There are a couple of potential solutions to this problem.\n",
