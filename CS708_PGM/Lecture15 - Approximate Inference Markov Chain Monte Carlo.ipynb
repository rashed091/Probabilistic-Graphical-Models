    "### Monte Carlo methods are algorithms that:\n",
    "* Generate samples from a given probability distribution $p(x)$.\n",
    "* Estimate expectations of functions $E[f(x)]$ under a distribution $p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Monte Carlo useful?\n",
    "* Can use samples of $p(x)$ to approximate $p(x)$ itself \n",
    "  * Allow us to do graphical model inference when we can't compute $p(x)$.\n",
    "* Expectations $E[f(x)]$ reveal interesting properties about $p(x)$, e.g., means and variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Monte Carlo\n",
    "* Direct sampling\n",
    "  * Hard to get rare events in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "  * Infeasible for MRFs, unless we know the normalizer $Z$.\n",
    "* Rejection sampling, Importance sampling\n",
    "  * Do not work well if the proposal $Q(x)$ is very different from $P(x)$.\n",
    "  * Yet constructing a $Q(x)$ similar to $P(x)$ can be difficult.\n",
    "    * Requires knowledge of the analytical form of $P(x)$ - but if we had that, we wouldn't even need to sample!\n",
    "* Intuition: Instead of a fixed proposal $Q(x)$, use an adaptive proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n",
    "MCMC algorithms feature adaptive proposals.\n",
    "* Instead of $Q(x^\\prime)$, use $Q(x^\\prime \\mid x)$ where $x^\\prime$ is the new state being sampled, and $x$ is the previous sample.\n",
    "* As $x$ changes, $Q(x^\\prime \\mid x)$ can also change (as a function of $x^\\prime$).\n",

    "### Markov Chains\n",
    "* A Markov Chain is a sequence of random variables $x^{(1)}$, $x^{(2)}$, ..., $x^{(n)}$ with the Markov Property\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x^{(n)}=x\\ |x^{(1)}, ..., x^{(n-1)})=P(x^{(n)}=x\\ |x^{(n-1)})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  * $P(x^{(n)}=x\\mid x^{(n-1)})$ is known as the **transition kernel**.\n",
    "  * The next state depends only on the preceding state.\n",
    "  * Random variables $x^{(i)}$ can be **vectors**.\n",
    "    * We define $x^{(i)}$ to be the t-th sample of **all** variables in a graphical model\n",
    "    * $x^{(i)}$ represents the entire state of the graphical model at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We study homogeneous Markov Chains, in which the transition kernel $P(x^{(n)}=x\\mid x^{(n-1)})$ is fixed with time.\n",
    "  * To emphasize this, we will call the kernel $T(x^\\prime\\mid x)$, where $x$ is the previous state and $x^\\prime$ is the next state.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Markov Chains Concepts\n",
    "Define a few important concepts of Markov Chains(MC)\n",
    "* **Probability distribution over states**: $\\pi^{(t)}(x)$ is a distribution over the state of the system $x$, at time $t$.\n",
    "  * When dealing with MCs, we don't think of the system as being in one state, but as having a distribution over states.\n",
    "  * For graphical models, remember that $x$ represents **all** variables.\n",
    "* **Transitions**: recall that states transition from $x^{(t)}$ to $x^{(t+1)}$ according to the transition kernel $T(x^\\prime\\mid  x)$.\n",
    "  * We can also transition entire distributions: \n",
    "    $$\\pi^{(t+1)}(x')=\\sum_{x} \\pi^{(t)}(x)T(x' \\mid x)$$\n",
    "  * At time t, state $x$ has probability mass $\\pi^{(t)}(x)$. The transition probability redistributes this mass to other states $x^\\prime$.\n",
    "* **Stationary distributions**: $\\pi^{(t)}(x)$ is stationary if it does not change under the transition kernel:\n",
    "$\\pi(x^\\prime)=\\sum_{x} \\pi(x)T(x^\\prime\\mid x)$, for all $x^\\prime$. To understand stationary distributions, we need to define some notions:\n",
    "  * **Irreducible**: an MC is irreducible if you can get from any state $x$ to any other state $x^\\prime$ with probability > 0 in a finite number of steps, i.e., there are no unreachabble parts of the state space.\n",
    "  * **Aperiodic**: an MC is aperiodic if you can return to any state $x$ at any time.\n",
    "    * Periodic MCs have states that need ≥2 time steps to return to (cycles).\n",
    "  * **Ergodic (or regular)**: an MC is ergodic if it is irreducible and aperiodic\n",
    "    * Ergodicity is important: it implies you can reach the stationary distribution $\\pi_{st}(x)$, no matter the initial distribution $\\pi^{(0)}(x)$.\n",
    "    * All good MCMC algorithms must satisfy ergodicity, so that you can’t initialize in a way that will never converge.\n",
    "  * **Reversible (detailed balance)**: an MC is reversible if there exists a distribution $\\pi(x)$ such that the detailed balance condition is satisfied:\n",
    "  $$\\pi(x')T(x\\ |x')=\\pi(x)T(x'\\ |x)$$\n",

    "### Why does Metropolis-Hastings work?\n",
    "Since we draw a sample $x^\\prime$ according to $Q(x^\\prime\\mid x)$, and then accept/reject according to $A(x^\\prime\\mid x)$, the transition kernel is:\n",

    "Gibbs Sampling is an Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that samples each random variable of a graphical, one at a time.

    "\n",
    "Choosing the proposal $Q(x' \\| x)$ is a tradeoff. The 'narrow', low-variance proposals have high acceptance, but may take many iterations to explore $P(x)$ fully because the proposed $x$ are too close. The 'wide', high-variance proposals have the potential to explore much of $P(x)$, but many proposals are rejected which slows down the sampler. \n",

    "If both $P(x)$ and $Q(x' \\| x)$ are Gaussian, the optimal acceptance rate is ~0.45 for D=1 dimension and approaches ~0.23 as D tends to infinity <d-cite key=\"roberts1997weak\"></d-cite>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we know if our proposal is any good? -- Autocorrelation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC chains always show autocorrelation (AC), because we are using the previous example to define the transition of the next example. (Note: AC means that adjacent samples in time are highly correlated.) We quantify AC with the autocorrelation fucntion of an r.v.x:\n",
