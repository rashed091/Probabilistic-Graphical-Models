    "#### Standard vs compact parametrization of  independent random variables\n",
    "Given random variables $X_i$ each representing the outcome of an independent coin toss, the standard parametrization of their joint distribution would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<d-math block>\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "\n",
    "One simple way to reduce the number of parameters needed, would be to represent the probability that each coin toss lands heads as $ \\theta_1, ... \\theta_n $.  Then we have the following compact representation requiring only $n$ parameters:\n",

    "##### Reduction in number of parameters\n",
    "In a distribution over $n$ binary variables, specifying the joint distribution will require $2^n - 1$ independent parameters (as stated in 3.1.1).
