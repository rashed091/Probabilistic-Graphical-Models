    "\n",
    "\"Bayes-ball\" algorithm is an algorithm that we can apply to retrieve independences directly from a graphical model. We say $X$ is **d-separated** from $Z$ given $Y$ if we cannot send a ball from any node in $X$ to any node in $Z$. The conditional probability statement (\"given $Y$\") is represented by shading the node in the graph. Examples of three basic directed graphical structures are shown below.\n",

    "## Undirected Graph Exmples\n",
    "In this section, we cover several well-known undirected graphical models: Boltzmann Machine (BM), Ising model, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), and Conditional Random Field (CRF).\n",
    "### Boltzmann Machine (BM)\n",
    "Boltzmann Machine is a fully connected graph with pairwise (edge) potentials on binary-valued nodes. One example is shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure class=\"l-body\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"col one\">\n",
    "            <img src=\"images/BM.png\" />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Its probability distribution can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\exp\\bigg\\{\\sum_{ij}\\phi_{ij}(x_i,x_j)\\bigg\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It could also be written in a quadratic way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\exp\\bigg\\{\\sum_{ij}\\theta_{ij}x_ix_j+\\sum_i\\alpha_ix_i+C\\bigg\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the overall free energy function has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H(x)=\\sum_{ij}(x_i-\\mu)\\Theta_{ij}(x_j-\\mu)=(x-\\mu)^T\\Theta(x-\\mu)$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can then be solved using quadratic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ising model\n",
    "In the Ising model, nodes are arranged in a regular topology (often a regular packing grid) and connected only to their geometric neighbors. It is like a sparse Boltzmann Machine. There is also the multi-state Ising model (also called Potts model), in which nodes can take multiple values instead of just binary values. One example of Ising model is shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure class=\"l-body\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"col one\">\n",
    "            <img src=\"images/IS.png\" />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Its probability distribution can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(X)=\\frac{1}{Z}\\exp\\bigg\\{\\sum_{i,j\\in N_i}\\theta_{ij}X_iX_j+\\sum_i \\theta_{i0}X_i\\bigg\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)\n",
    "The Restricted Bolzmann Machine is a bipartite graph with connections between one layer of hidden units and one layer of visible units. One example is shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure class=\"l-body\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"col two\">\n",
    "            <img src=\"images/RBM.png\" />\n",
    "        </div>\n",

    "\n",
    "Its probability distribution can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(x,h|\\theta)=\\exp\\bigg\\{\\sum_i\\theta_i\\phi_i(x_i) + \\sum_j\\theta_j\\phi_j(h_j) + \\sum_{i,j}\\theta_{i,j}\\phi_{i,j}(x_i,h_j)-A(\\theta)\\bigg\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "RBM has some appealing properties. For example, factors are marginally dependent and factors are conditionally independent given observations on the visible nodes. They enable one to use iterative Gibbs sampling for inference and learning on RBM. If the edges in RBM were directed, there would be plenty of V-structures in the graph (lots of dependences) that increase the inference difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Random Field (CRF)\n",
    "Conditional random field is an analogous form of HMM in the undirected case. It allows arbitrary dependencies on the input. For example, when labeling $X_i$, future observations can be taken into account. An example of CRF is shown in the figure:\n",

    "        </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution could be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_\\theta(y|x)=\\frac{1}{Z(\\theta,x)}\\exp\\bigg\\{\\sum_c\\theta_cf_c(x,y_c)\\bigg\\}$\n"
