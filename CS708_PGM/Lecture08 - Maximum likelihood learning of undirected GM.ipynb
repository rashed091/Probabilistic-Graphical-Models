    "#### MLE for undirected graphical models\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an undirected graphical model and we know that using the **Hammersley–Clifford theorem** that it can be represented by a Gibbs distribution.\n",
    "Now the question arises if we can follow the sane procedure as for directed graphical Models to find the MLE of an UGM?  The answer is no - we cannot.\n",
    "This is because for directed graphical models the log likelihood decomposes into a sum of terms, one per family i.e. (node + it’s parents).\n",
    "However the same is not applicable to undirected graphical models, as there is a normalization constant $Z$ that is a function oaf all the parameters and thus the probability distribution does not split into a sum of terms.\n",

    "### Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS): Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this second algorithm is where we start thinking more about feature-based models. So far, when we mention potential functions, we feel that it is trivial. Either you learn it, or you simply specify numbers at will. But there are some problems. To illustrate this, let's take a look at a real task of spell checking. One of the most useful and powerful devices in spell checking is to build affinity models of character strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature-based Clique Potentials\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were to look at the consecutive appearance of 3 characters, $c_1, c_2, c_3$, which we represent with the potential function $\\psi(x_c)$. The rationale behind this is that we can use this to score the likelihood of misspelling. E.g. If we see the sequence 'zyz', we would know that such a sequence does not exist in the English vocabulary and therefore has a very high likelihood of being a misspelling. On the other hand, if we see the sequence 'ink', we know that there are some words which contain this sequence and consequently a lower likelihood of misspelling. This is an example of how the potential can help us do spell checking. However, if we were to iterate over all the different combinations of triplets in the alphabet, this would imply that we have $26^3$ features, and this gets worse if we increase the size of the sequence. Such a general \"tabular\" potential function would be exponentially costly for inference and have exponential numbers of parameters that we must learn from limited data, which would exhaust the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to change the graphical model to make cliques smaller. But this changes the dependencies, and may force us to make more independence assumptions than we would like. Another solution is to keep the same graphical model, but use a less general parameterization of the clique potentials. And this is the idea behind feature-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Features**_:\n",
    "In our earlier example of spell checking, since we know how frequent certain triplets are based on the existing knowledge (e.g. a dictionary or our own vocabulary), we can pick out those we have the greatest confidence in and assign them features. Here a feature is defined as a function which is vacuous for most joint settings except a few particular ones, in which it returns either high or low values. E.g. we can define a feature $f_{ing} = 10$ and $f_{ate} = 9$, and so on and so forth. By the time we get to the 50th or 100th feature, we assume that these combinations are less likely and assign them some arbitrary small likelihood of $\\alpha$. We can also define features when the inputs are continuous. Then the idea of having a cell on which the feature is active is no longer relevant, but we might still have a compact parameterization of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a different approach from deep learning where we become overcomplete and hope that the big data will funnel in to get these numbers into place, with no guarantee, because we don't know how much data is necessary to get the numbers into place, i.e. we don't know the sample complexity. Instead, here we have a way in which we utilize human knowledge to build a model. And even today, the most successful speech recognition models have their foundations based on this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Features as Micropotentials**_:\n",
    "Let's move on to the details. By exponentiating them, each feature function can be made into a \"micropotential.\" We can multiply these micropotentials together to get a clique potential. For example, a clique potential $\\psi(c_1,c_2,c_2)$ could be expressed as:\n",

    "</d-math>\n",
    "\n",
    "There's still a potential over $26^3$ possible settings, but only uses $K$ parameters if there are $K$ features, and by having one indicator function per combination of $x_c$, we recover the standard tabular potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Combining Features**_:\n",
    "Note that these features can be handcrafted. We also append weights $\\theta_k$ in the function because we do not have contextual knowledge of how important each feature is. The marginal over the clique is a generalized exponential family distribution, actually, a GLIM:\n",

    "</d-math>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the features may be overlapping, unconstrained indicators or any function of any subset of the clique variables.

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphical representation of a 1-D chain CRF is depicted in the figure above. CRFs can be thought of as an evolution of HMMs, but unlike HMMs they are discriminative models, and directly\n",
    "model the conditional distribution $P(\\mathbf{Y}|\\mathbf{X})$ instead of the joint distribution $P(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y})$.\n",
    "Most often, we care about the prediction anyway, so modeling it directly avoids the computation of the joint probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRFs offer two key advantages over HMMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They model the entire observed sequence. For example, in a task where we want to predict the Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags for a sequence of words in a sentence, it helps to know the entire sequence of words while predicting the POS tag at time step $t$.\n",
    "- They do not suffer from the label bias problem. We briefly discuss the problem below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "  <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col two\">\n",
    "      <img src=\"images/label_bias.png\" />\n",

    "**The Label Bias Problem**:\n",
    "In the figure above, we can observe that state 1 transitions into only two states (state 1, and 2); whereas state 2 can potentially transition into all the five available states. Furthermore, we observe that at every time step, state 1 always prefers to transition to state 2 over state 1, and similarly state 2 always prefers to transition to state 2 over other 4 options. However, path ```1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1``` is the most likely path with probability of $0.09$, whereas the *intuitively correct* path of ```1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2``` has a probability mass of only $0.054$. The reason for this counter-intuitive phenomena is rooted in the fact that probability mass from state 2 is distributed across all states. Thus, the probabilities being locally normalized is not desirable here. CRFs overcome this problem by having *potential scores* instead of probabilities, which are *globally normalized*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having motivated why such models might be useful, let us see to learn and do inference over these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inference and learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The inference algorithm for CRFs is very simple, and just like HMMs, we can do Viterbi decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of learning is essentially learning the weights ($\\mathbf{w}$) for the features $\\mathbf{f}(y_i, y_{i-1}, \\mathbf{x}_{1:n})$ used to score the configurations. One can draw parallels here to a well known class of discriminative classifiers --- logistic regression, and just like logistic regression, we can do gradient ascent over the weights to increase the conditional probability over the observed set of $\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}$ pairs. Given the 1-D chain structure, the normalizing term (or the partition function) can be tractably computed. In practice, gradient ascent has very slow convergence, and other alternatives like conjugate gradient method and limited memory quasi-newton methods can be used for faster learning.\n",
    "Most CRFs, especially ones involving arbitrary structure, are intractable in general owing to the difficulty in computing the partition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**: CRFs have been very successful in a wide range of applications across different fields. In NLP, they are commonly used for POS-tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and other tagging problems. In computer vision, they have found utility in image segmentation, image restoration, handwriting recognition among other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recent developments**: A popular recent trend in NLP tagging problems is to combine CRFs with neural representations from CNNs, and LSTMs instead of the hand-crafted features $\\mathbf{f}(y_i, y_{i-1}, \\mathbf{x}_{1:n})$, and the weights for the CNNs and LSTMs are also learnt as a part of the learning process (through back-propagation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, a tutorial <d-cite key=\"sutton2012introduction\"></d-cite> from Sutton, and McCallum is an excellent resource to know more in-depth details about CRFs\n"
