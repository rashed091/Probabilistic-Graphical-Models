    "## Recap of the message passing algorithm and its properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lectures, we have looked at exact inference algorithms and observed that they are not very efficient. Hence, a need for more efficient inference algorithms arises. This lecture will focus on such algorithms which are called *Approximate Inference Algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference using graphical models can be used to compute marginal distributions, conditional distributions, the likelihood of observed data, and the modes of the density function. We have already studied that exact inference can be accomplished either using brute force (i.e. eliminating all the required variables in any order) or by refining our elimination order so as to reduce the number of computations. In this context, the belief propagation or sum-product message passing algorithm run on a clique tree generated by a given variable elimination ordering was introduced as an equivalent way of performing variable elimination. We have seen that the overall complexity of the algorithm is exponential in the number of variables in the largest elimination clique which is generated when we use a given elimination order. The tree width of a graph was defined as one less than the smallest possible value of the cardinality of the largest elimination clique, ranging over all possible elimination orderings. If we can find an optimal elimination order, we can reduce the complexity of belief propagation. As the problem of finding the best elimination order is NP-hard, exact inference is also NP-hard. Belief propagation is guaranteed to converge to a unique and fixed set of values after a finite number of iterations when it is run on trees.\n",

    "### Message Passing Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The message passing protocol dictates that a node can only send a message to its neighbors when and only when it has received the messages from all of its other neighbors. Hence, to naively compute the marginal of a given node, we should treat that node as the root and run the message passing algorithm. This is illustrated by the three figures given below, each of which shows the messaging directions to be used when computing the given marginal:\n",

    "### Local and Global Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $$\\{\\tau_C, C \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$$ and $$\\{\\tau_S, S \\in \\mathcal{S}\\}$$ denote the set of functions which are associated with cliques and separator sets respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sets of functions are locally consistent if the following properties hold:\n",
    "- $$\\sum_{x'_S} \\tau_S(x'_S) = 1, \\forall S \\in \\mathcal{S}$$  \n",
    "- $$\\sum_{x'_C|x'_S = x_S} \\tau_C(x'_C) = \\tau_S(x_S), \\forall C \\in \\mathcal{C}, \\forall S \\subset C$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first property implies that the functions associated with each separator set are proper marginals. The second property requires that if we sum any clique function $$\\tau_C$$ over all the variables in the clique $$C$$ which are not present in a sepset $$S \\subset C$$, we must obtain a function $$\\tau_S(X_S)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementioned sets of functions are global consistent if all $$\\tau_C$$ and $$\\tau_S$$ are valid marginals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For junction trees, local consistency is equivalent to global consistency. A proof of this fact can be found at this [link](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring09/cos513/scribe/lecture07.pdf).\n",

    "However, for graphs which are not trees, local consistency does not always imply global consistency.\n",

    "Similarly, if we construct a clique tree for the above graph (shown below), we see that the random variable $$C$$ is part of two non-neighbouring cliques. Hence, it is impossible for the two clique potentials which contain $$C$$ to agree on the marginal associated with $$C$$ since no information about $$C$$ is ever passed in the messages.\n",

    "## Loopy Belief Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Above examples illustrate that on a non-tree graphical model the message passing algorithms are not guaranteed to provide a correct solution to the inference problem anymore. One way to deal with this is to convert a non-tree graphical model into a junction tree. However, such conversion often leads to graph with extremely large tree-width which is also unaffordable. For example in the following figure, an Ising model with $$N \\times N$$ grid and $$N\\sim O(1000)$$ will yield a clique with $$2^{100}$$ entries. Therefore, we have to do approximation inference such as loopy belief propagation or mean field approximation.\n",

Previous studies showed that directly copying the idea of belief propagation from tree to non-tree graphical model leads to two outcomes:\n",

Even if the algorithm converges in the end, due to the non-convexity of Bethe Variational Problem, there are no guarantees on the global optimum. In general, there are no guarantees that $$A_{\\text{Bethe}}(\\theta) $$ is a lower bound of $$A(\\theta)$$.\n",
