Homework is 1 day late

My solution implements a version of message passing / variable elimination
that uses the fact that our MRF is a tree.
We run send messages up and down parent-child edges, arriving at an
asymptotically optimal variable ordering.

I implemented Factor.* methods in factors.py, but did not use clique_tree.py
at all.
Instead, I changed binary_tree.py so that the nodes hold some extra information.
Most of the model itself is implemented in mrf_tree.py

For your convenience, the output from solution.py was saved into output_ABC.txt
(solutions for parts A, B, C) and output_DEFG.txt (solutions for parts D,E,F,G)
and slightly formatted.
