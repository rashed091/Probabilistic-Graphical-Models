The histograms seem to be rougly the same.
Mean black pixel count is 56.9% in the case of 10% error rate and 57.7% in the
case of 20% error rate.

Given error rates of 0.6% and 1% respectively (which can explain at most a
56.9% * 0.004 ~= 0.23% difference out of 57.7% - 56.9% = 0.8% difference), it
seems that most of Z frequency variance comes from sampling randomness, not
noise randomness. Which explains the similarity of the
histograms.
