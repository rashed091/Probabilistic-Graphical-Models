The submission contains both code, files/plots and the written answers of the
assignments (c) - (f).
Some functions are refactored from starter code. For example,
get_posterior_by_sampling() returns Z frequencies as a list, not a dict (so that
plt.hist() can be used), and the image denoising from posteriors happens in a
separate function.

orig.txt, noisy_10.txt and noisy_20.txt had to be removed from the submission
(despite being used by submission.py) because of submission size limits.
