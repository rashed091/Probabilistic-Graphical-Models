    "A *finite probability space* is the most basic data structure used throughout this course for modeling uncertainty (often just called  a probability space or a probability model).\n",

    "A *finite probability space* consists of two ingredients:\n",

    "- a **sample space** $\\Omega$ consisting of a finite (i.e., not infinite) number of collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we specify a sample space is usually not unique, for instance we can add extraneous outcomes that all have probability 0 or extraneous information that doesn't matter. Generally speaking it's best to choose a sample space that is as simple as possible for modeling what we care about solving. (For example, if we were rolling a six-sided die, and we actually only care about whether the face shows up at least 4 or not, then it's sufficient to just keep track of two outcomes, \"at least 4\" and \"less than 4\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "- an **assignment of probabilities** $\\mathbb {P}$: for each possible outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, we assign a probability $\\mathbb {P}(\\text {outcome }\\omega )\\in[0, 1]$ at least 0 and at most 1, where we require that the probabilities across all the possible outcomes in the sample space add up to 1: $\\sum _{\\omega \\in \\Omega }\\mathbb {P}(\\text {outcome }\\omega )=1.$\n",
    "\n",

    "**Definition of a “finite random variable\" (in this course, we will just call this a “random variable\")**: Given a finite probability space $(\\Omega ,\\mathbb {P})$, a *finite random variable* $X$ is a mapping from the sample space $\\Omega$ to a set of values $\\mathcal{X}$ that random variable $X$ can take on. (We will often call $\\mathcal{X}$ the “alphabet\" of random variable $X$.):\n",

    "\n",
    "**Quick summary**: There's an underlying experiment corresponding to probability space $(\\Omega ,\\mathbb {P})$. Once the experiment is run, let $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ denote the outcome of the experiment. Then the random variable takes on the specific value of $X(\\omega )\\in \\mathcal{X}$.\n",

    "### Random Variables Notation and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we denote random variables with capital/uppercase letters, such as $X, W, I$, etc. We use the phrases “probability table\", “probability mass function\" (abbreviated as PMF), and “probability distribution\" (often simply called a distribution) to mean the same thing, and in particular we denote the probability table for $X$ to be $p_ X$ or $p_ X(\\cdot )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write $p_ X(x)$ to denote the entry of the probability table that has label $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ where $\\mathcal{X}$ is the set of values that random variable $X$ takes on. Note that we use lowercase letters like x to denote variables storing nonrandom values. We can also look up values in a probability table using specific outcomes, e.g., from earlier, we have $p_ W(\\text {rainy}) = 1/6$ and $p_ I(1)=1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use the same notation as in math where a function $f$\n",
    "might also be written as $f(\\cdot )$ to explicitly indicate that it is the function of one variable. Both $f$ and $f(\\cdot )$ refer to a function whereas $f(x)$ refers to the value of the function $f$ evaluated at the point $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how to use all this notation, recall that a probability table consists of nonnegative entries that add up to 1. In fact, each of the entries is at most 1 (otherwise the numbers would add to more than 1). For a random variable $X$ taking on values in $\\mathcal{X}$, we can write out these constraints as:\n",
    "$$0 \\le p_ X(x) \\le 1\\quad \\text {for all }x\\in \\mathcal{X}, \\qquad \\sum _{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} p_ X(x) = 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in the course, if we are making statements about all possible outcomes of $X$, we will omit writing out the alphabet $\\mathcal{X}$ explicitly. For example, instead of the above, we might write the following equivalent statement:\n",
    "$$0 \\le p_ X(x) \\le 1\\quad \\text {for all }x, \\qquad \\sum _ x p_ X(x) = 1.$$"
