    "\n",
    "RAML allows the whole exploration space. The data points that are closed to the observed data are more likely to be examine. However because it consists of a single execution of the E-M step it \"does not have time\" to integrate any new information and reconsider the probabilities according to which it observes new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally SPG allows for the whole exploration space. In addition the E-M steps are executed \n",
    "multiple times. As a result it  integrates  new information that is obtained by the exploration (here we are using the fact that $\\alpha >0$). A data point that is examined at the $n^{th}$ iteration will potentially affect the shaping of $\\theta^n$. As a result it will affect $q^{n+1}$ and thereafter which points should be \"explored\" in order to perform a Monte Carlo estimation at the M-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpolation Algorithm\n",
    "In the above we saw that by choosing the proper reward function we can discourage (e.g. by setting $R=R_\\delta$) or encourage (by setting $R=R_c$) exploration. Larger exploration space alleviates the exposure bias problem and yields better estimates. However algorithms with larger exploration space\n",
    "tend to converge slower, thus having to run for a longer period of time, since they explore more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation algorithm tries to leverage the advantages of both, having a small and having a large exploration space. It exploits the natural idea of starting with a more restricted  exploration  space which gradually expands as time progresses. By varying the hyperparameters in the ERPO framework it starts by trying to estimate the MLE estimator. Then, as time progress it behaves \n",
    "more and more like $SPG$. Formally, in the Interpolation Algorithm,  the $E$ step is substituted by\n",
    "$$q_{n+1}(\\mathbf{y} |\\mathbf{x} ) \\propto \\exp \\bigg\\{c\\big(\\lambda_{1,n+1} \\log  p_{\\theta^n}(\\mathbf{y} |\\mathbf{x} ) + \\lambda_{2,n+1} R_\\delta(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{y}^{*}) +\\lambda_{3,n+1} R_c(\\mathbf{y} ,\\mathbf{y}^{*}) \\big)\\bigg\\},$$\n",

    " corresponding record $x'$ (instead of $x$), the ground truth output of the case is indeed $y'$ itself (as $y'$ describes \n",
    " content $x'$, and is of course in the same style of itself). We thus can specify the second objective that reconstructs \n",
    " $y'$ given $(x', y')$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{L}_{style}(\\theta) = \\log p_{\\theta}(y'|x',y')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call it the style preservation objective. The objective essentially treats the reference sentence encoder and the \n",
    "decoder together as an auto-encoding module, and effectively drives the model to absorb the characteristics of reference \n",
    "sentence and apply to the generated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two objectives are coupled together and train the model to achieve the desired goals: \n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the balancing parameter and gives us the ability to weight the two objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content Coverage Constraint\n",
    "Generally the above model can achieve good performance but sometimes it can \n",
    "still not  express the desired content accurately. So an additional learning constraint is devised based on\n",
    " the nature of content description—each data tuple in the content record should usually be mentioned exactly once \n",
    "in the generated sentence. This constraint on $x$ enables a simple yet effective way to encourage \n",
    "the behavior. Intuitively, we want each tuple to be copied once and only once on average. \n",
    "We thus minimize the following $L2$ constraint that drives the aggregated copy probability of each data tuple to be $1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $p(t)$ denotes the copy distribution over all data tuples at decoding step $t$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Target-guided conversation: something between the previous two tasks, the conversation is in open-domain and we want to control the conversation strategy to reach a desired topic in the end of conversation. It can bridge task-oriented dialog and open-domain chit-chat, e.g. conversational reccommender system, education, psychotherapy.\n",
