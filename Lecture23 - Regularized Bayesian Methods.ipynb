    "## Learning GMs\n",
    "There are different frameworks to learn GMs: First, Bayesian framework. It allows priors to be introduced. Both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian tricks can be applied to learning these models. Second, max-margin framework. SVM is an example of this framework(it can be used to learn not only a classifier but also a graphical model). Third, there are also the kernel methods, of which SVM is also an example. Gaussian processes, another nonparametric bayesian paradigm, is another example of application of kernel methods. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "These frameworks has complementary advantages of one another. For example, in the Bayesian framework, we have prior knowledges, we can bypass model selection; in SVM, outliers do not affect the results, etc. It is possible to use the ideas of these different frameworks and enjoy the advantages of all in one single paradigm. Potentially these ideas could be used to further empower the already powerful deep-learning models, which would be an interesting new topic to explore in the future.\n",

    "where $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model from some hypothesis space, $x$ is observed data. The Bayesian framework allows you to derive a posterior distribution of the model. The prior distribution, i.e. the $\\pi(\\mathcal{M})$ part of the model needs to be provided, usually selected by the needs, while the $p(\\mathbf{x}\\vert\\mathcal{M})$ part of the model need to be designed and could be the graphical part.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "In parametric Bayesian inference, $\\mathcal{M}$ is represented as a finite set of parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "1. a parametric likelihood: $\\mathbf{x} \\sim p(\\cdot\\vert\\theta)$\n",
    "2. Prior on $\\theta$: $\\pi(\\theta)$\n",

    "\n",
    "You don't make too much flexibility in the choice of the model itself. You can make a choice of a Gaussian model or a Dirichlet distribution, the flexibility is in the way how it is parameterized. Define a prior distribution of the parameters, and you'll get a posterior distribution of the parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model itself becomes a space for you to make inference on. For example you have an unknown number of components in a mixed model, or an unknown number of dimensions in the latent feature models. Popular nonparametric Bayesian models include Dirichlet Process, Indian Buffet process and Gaussian process. These models are more powerful than the parametric Bayesian models. Nonparametric Bayesian models allow us to pay more attention to the power of data, and the interplay between the data and prior is more natural. It allows us to bypass the model selection problem and let the data itself determine model complexity.\n",

    "\n",

    "The two learning paradigms have complementary advantages. Likelihood-based models are probablistic, therefore by introducing a prior distribution, Bayesian learning can be easily performed. Besides, probablistic models allow for introduction of latent variables so that you can have enable latent space models. SVM, on the other hand, does not allow for hidden variables because it is non-probablistic. But the advantages are that the support vector property gives good guarantee on generizability, and that it allows for kernel tricks. \n",
