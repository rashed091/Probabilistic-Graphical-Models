# Reminders

- The datasets we are playing with here are idiosyncratic. There may be questions regarding the data. Remember to encourage participants to ask questions about the data publicly, so that everybody can benefit together. 
- The corollary to this fact: we may end up with 5-10 minutes of answering questions regarding the data. We should announce up-front that this is okay to do.
