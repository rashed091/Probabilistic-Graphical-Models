    "All probability distributions must have a certain properties, which we refer to as the **axioms of probability**. \n",

    "A discrete distribution is defined by its **probability mass** function, with nonzero values as discrete points. We can speak of a **set of events** within the **sample space** of all possible events. For discrete distributions the axioms then become:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability for any set, A, is bounded between 0 and 1:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 \\le P(A) \\le 1 $$\n",
    "- For a discrete distribution, the sum of the probability over the Sample Space = 1:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(S) = \\sum_{All\\ i}P(a_i) = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of finite independent unions is the sum of their probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\\\ \n",
    "if\\ and\\ only\\ if\\\\ \n",
    "A \\cap B = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to discrete distributions, a **continuous distribution** is defined by its **probability density** function. For a continuous distribution the first and second axioms become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 \\le P(a, b) = \\int_a^b P(x) dx  \\le 1$$\n",

    "$$P(-\\infty, \\infty) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty P(x) dx  = 1$$\n",

    "The following example shows how we can expand the numerator and denominator when applying Bayes' theorem. The critical, and often difficult, part is to determine the probabilities of all of the alternative hypothesis summed to compute the numerator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspector Andrea Markov receives a call that Lord Fauntleroy has been murdered in his manor house. She is told that only the cook and butler were present in the house at the time of the crime and that there is no evidence of an intruder. Further, she learns that the only possible murder weapons are a knife and poison. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Inspector realizes that the cook and the butler could have acted alone or together Therefore, we will assume independence: $p(C,B) = p(C)p(B)$, where $p(C)$ is the probability the cook is guilty and $p(B)$ is the probability the butler is guilty.   \n",
    "\n",
    "How can Inspector Markov compute a prior probability of the four possible cases, $p(B|K)$, $p(B|P)$, $p(C|K)$ and $p(C|P)$, where $K = knife$ and $P = poison$. Let's start with Bayes' Theorem for the first case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(B|K) = \\frac{p(K|B)\\ p(B)}{p(K)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reformulate this relationship as the calculation of a marginal distribution:\n",
    "$$p(B|K) = \\sum_C p(B,C|K) \\\\\n",
    "or,\\\\\n",
    "= \\sum_C \\frac{p(B,C,K)}{P(k)} \\\\\n",
    "= \\frac{\\sum_C p(K|B,C)\\ P(B,C)}{\\sum_{C,B,W} p(W|B,C)\\ P(B,C)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the numerator or normalization is summed over all variables to compute the **marginal distribution** of a knife being the murder weapon, $p(K)$.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, keeping in mind that $p(C,B) = p(C)p(B)$ we can write this relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(B|K) = \\frac{p(B)\\ \\sum_C p(K|B,C)\\ P(C)}{\\sum_B P(B)\\ \\sum_{C,W} p(W|B,C)\\ P(C)} \\\\\n",
    "= \\frac{p(B)\\ \\sum_C p(K|B,C)\\ P(C)}{\\sum_B P(B)\\ \\sum_C P(C)\\ \\sum_{W} p(W|B,C)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorization of the numerator is not unique. We can also write:\n",

    "$$p(B|K)\n",

    "\n",
    "So, the numerator is the same for both the case of the butler or the cook being the murderer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we expand this relationship, we need to introduce some notation. Let $\\wedge$ be the logical AND operator and $\\urcorner$ be the logical NOT operator. Using this notation we can expand the numerator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(B)\\ \\sum_C p(K|B,C)\\ P(C) \\\\\n",
    "= p(B) \\big[ p(C)\\ p(K|B \\wedge C) +  p( \\urcorner C)\\ p(K|B \\wedge \\urcorner C) \\big]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_B P(B)\\ \\sum_C P(C)\\ \\sum_{W} p(W|B,C) $$   \n",
    "   \n",
    "Now, the probability of poison has been determined to be zero; $p(P) = 0$. This reduces the number of possible cases to 8.  Additionally, since there are only two possible suspects, $p(\\urcorner B \\wedge \\urcorner C) = 0$. The two cases (one for each possible weapon) where neither butler or cook committed the crime must be zero. We can now expand the denominator with these simplifications as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$= p(B) \\Big[ p(C)\\ \\big( p(K|B \\wedge C) + p(P|B \\wedge C)\\big)  + p( \\urcorner C)\\ \\big(  p(K|B \\wedge \\urcorner C) + p(P|B \\wedge \\urcorner C)  \\big) \\Big] \\\\\n",

    "In summary, the denominator sums the probabilities of all possible alternative hypothesis. Details for the other cases are left to you as an exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "As advertised there are six none-zero probability alternatives in the denominator. Consider what would happen if some the variables had more than two possible states. For example, how many alternatives are there if there were four possible murder weapons. Or, how many states are created if we added 2 addition suspects as well as four possible murder weapons. These though experiments should lead you to understand that computational complexity grows rather quickly (combinatorically) with the number of states.   "
