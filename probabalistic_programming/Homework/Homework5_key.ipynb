    "Robotics are becoming common place in many business situations. For example in retail sales robotics are used in warehouse management. Amazon is widely known to be a leader in this area. But, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, UK online grocery retailer, Ocado, is rumored to have even more sophisticated order fulfilment robotics.\n",

    "Not surprisingly, companies like Amazon and Ocado do not disclose much information on their robotics. Nonetheless, we can be sure that sensor fusion is a significant problem. For example, sensor fusion is a significant issue with self driving cars. See for example:\n",

    "These types of complex robots require years, even decades, to develop and perfect. In reality, the processes used in such complex robots are decomposable into a large number of **simple single tasks**. The complete system then operates by integrating the many single tasks into a **multi-task** environment. To avoid this complexity (and finish the course in less than 10 years:) you will address a simple single task problem. \n",

    "Bob's Orchards is a premium seller of apples and pears. Bob's customers pay a substantial premium for superior fruit. To satisfy these customers, Bob's must ensure that the fruit delivered is correctly packed and perfectly ripe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many legacy industries requiring specialized human skills, Bob's is facing a talent problem. Many of the human inspectors who expertly check each piece of fruit shipped for ripeness are approaching retirement age. Management's attempts to recruit younger people to apprentice as fruit inspectors have been, well, fruitless (oh, sorry!:). Therefore, it has become imperative to find some type of automated system which can reduce the workload on the diminishing number of human inspectors. To address this problem, Bob's is deploying technology from Robots R Us.\n"

    "## Scenario  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first robotic system to be deployed at Bob's uses a multi-sensor array to determine if the fruit being shipped is at the correct ripeness. There are two sensors, a vision system that examines the fruit for spots, indicating the fruit is over ripe, and a smell sensor that determines if the fruit is not ripe enough. If either sensor indicates the fruit is bad it is sent to a human inspector. In addition customers may reject even perfect fruit for no apparent reason, whereas others seem perfectly happy with less than perfect fruit.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distributions, decisions and utilities of this system can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. The unconditional probability distribution of the ripeness of the fruit being packed is known\n",
    "2. The probability that each sensor reads correctly or not is known experimentally. A table must be constructed that gives computes the conditional probability of accepting or rejecting fruit given the actual ripeness. More on this latter.\n",
    "3. The decision is then made to have a human inspector examine the fruit or not. \n",
    "4. The utility of the human inspection of the fruit. \n",
    "4. The conditional probability of a customer accepting or not good depending on if the order is good or bad. \n",
    "5. The utility of the customer accepting or rejecting an order.  "

    "Most unfortunately for Bob's, Robots R U engineers have little experience with fruit processing and the sensors are known to be unreliable. The probability of a correct reading from the spot sensor is 0.9 and for the smell sensor the probability of a correct reading is 0.7. If ether sensor indicates the fruit is not ripe, we consider the fruit as bad. This leads to 4 possible result states when integrating data from these sensors:   \n",

    "- Good fruit is considered bad, a false negative.   \n",

    "- Bad fruit is considered good, a false positive.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we demand agreement from both sensors that the fruit is good we must construct a table based on the following logic. This leads to the following interpretation of the sensor tuples (spots, smell); \n",
    "- Both sensors indicate good (G,G), in which case the fruit is assumed good.    \n",
    "- Either or both sensors indicate the fruit is bad (G,B, B,G, BB) in which case the fruit is assumed bad. \n",

    "- The spot sensor reads in error, and the smell sensor reads correctly; (F,T),\n",
    "- Both the spot and smell sensors read in error; (F,F). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the two sensors work independently, and measure quite different physical properties of the fruit, so it is a good assumption the probability of true and false readings for the two senors are statistically independent.
