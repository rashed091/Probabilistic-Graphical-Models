    "Inspector Andrea Markov receives a call that Lord Fauntleroy has been murdered in his manor house. She is told that only the cook and butler were present in the house at the time of the crime and that there is no evidence of an intruder. Further, she learns that the only possible murder weapons are a knife and poison. \n",

    "Before leaving the police station the Inspector instructs Sergeant Bernoulli to gather information on the outcomes of similar murder investigations. She tells the Sergeant that it is entirely possible that both the butler and the cook could have worked together. Since the cook and the butler could have acted alone or together, we will assume independence: $p(C,B) = p(C)p(B)$  \n",

    "> **Hint 2:** Computing the numerators is relatively straight forward. For the denominator there are 8 possible cases. However two cases can be eliminated, since there are only two suspects $P( \\urcorner C \\wedge  \\urcorner B) = 0$, where $ \\urcorner$ is the logical not operator and $\\wedge$ is the logical and.
