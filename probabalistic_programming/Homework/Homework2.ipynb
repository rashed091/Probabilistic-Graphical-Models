    "In the previous homework, you computed the posterior probabilities of either the cook (C), the butler (B), or both, being a murdered given the choice of weapons (K = knife, P = poison). In this exercise you will construct a Directed Bayesian Graphical Model or belief network for the available evidence. \n",

    "As Inspector Markov has continued her investigation she has discovered an unexplained set of footprints, evidence that a third person may have been involved in the crime. Given that there is no evidence of a break in, she realizes that if a third person was involved they must have had assistance from either the cook, the butler or both. In other words, the cook and the butler may be guilty even if they did not commit the actual killing with the knife. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inspector also learns that further tests on the body have confirmed Dr Turing's conclusion that the cause of death was only a knife. \n",
