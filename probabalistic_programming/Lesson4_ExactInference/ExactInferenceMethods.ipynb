    "We have seen several approaches to representation of probabilistic graphical models. Now, we will turn our attention to **inference algorithms**. The goal of inference is to compute the **posterior distribution** of one or more variables in the model given **evidence**. Alternatively, we can say that inference is used to return results to a **query** on the model. \n",

    "To understand the need for efficient inference algorithms it helps to understand the computational complexity of inference of a graphical model. If we use a **tabular** solution algorithm, the complexity is NP; meaning the number of operations required grow as order $= O(n^k)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the face of things, it might seem that performing inference on graphical models of any scale is hopeless. While it is true, there are no general algorithms for solving the inference problem, there are many practical and widely applicable cases for which efficient inference algorithms exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to reducing the computational complexity of graphical model inference algorithms is use of independencies. The naive approach is to simple the full table of marginal distributions of the graph variables. This approach has combinatorial or NP complexity. By combining conditional probabilities with evidence, the complexity of marginal influence can be significantly reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms we will explore take advantage of special structures commonly found in model graphs. Part of the tick is to rearrange the graph to create the desired structure. These algorithms combined with conditional probabilities and evidence result in even large scale models becoming tractable.    "
