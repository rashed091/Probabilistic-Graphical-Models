All three methods seem to be converging to the same general region of the
posterior.

The burn-in period is sufficient for 'same' and 'rand' methods (even somewhat
excessive), but insufficient for 'neg' method.

There is some fluctuation in energy levels, but that fluctuation is roughly
around the same energy level. The chain does not seem to be stuck (since it
jumps around in adjacent iterations, which is most clear on the
"plot_c_same.png" plot because of scale), but it fluctuates in the same general
energy level region, since significantly deviating outcomes are exponentially
less likely.
