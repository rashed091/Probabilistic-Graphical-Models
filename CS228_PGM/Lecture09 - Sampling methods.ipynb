    "In practice, the probabilistic models that we use are often quite complex, and simple algorithms like variable elimination may be too slow for them. In fact, many interesting classes of models may not admit exact polynomial-time solutions at all, and for this reason, much research effort in machine learning is spent on developing algorithms that yield *approximate* solutions to the inference problem. This section begins our study of such algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist two main families of approximate algorithms: *variational* methods{% include sidenote.html id=\"note-variational\" note=\"Variational inference methods take their name from the *calculus of variations*, which deals with optimizing functions that take other functions as arguments.\" %}, which formulate inference as an optimization problem, as well as *sampling* methods, which produce answers by repeatedly generating random numbers from a distribution of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling methods can be used to perform both marginal and MAP inference queries; in addition, they can compute various interesting quantities, such as expectations $\\E[f(X)]$ of random variables distributed according to a given probabilistic model. Sampling methods have historically been the main way of performing approximate inference, although over the past 15 years variational methods have emerged as viable (and often superior) alternatives.\n",

    "## Sampling from a probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "As a warm-up, let's think for a minute how we might sample from a multinomial distribution with $k$ possible outcomes and associated probabilities $\\theta_1, \\dotsc, \\theta_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling, in general, is not an easy problem. Our computers can only generate samples from very simple distributions{% include sidenote.html id=\"note-pseudorandom\" note=\"Even those samples are not truly random. They are actually taken from a deterministic sequence whose statistical properties (e.g. running averages) are indistinguishable from a truly random one. We call such sequences *pseudorandom*.\" %}, such as the uniform distribution over $[0,1]$. All sampling techniques involve calling some kind of simple subroutine multiple times in a clever way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we may reduce sampling from a multinomial variable to sampling a single uniform variable by subdividing a unit interval into $k$ regions with region $i$ having size $\\theta_i$. We then sample uniformly from $[0,1]$ and return the value of the region in which our sample falls.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Our technique for sampling from multinomials naturally extends to Bayesian networks with multinomial variables, via a method called *ancestral* (or *forward*) sampling. Given a probability $p(x_1, \\dotsc, x_n)$ specified by a Bayes net, we sample variables in topological order. We start by sampling the variables with no parents; then we sample from the next generation by conditioning these variables' CPDs to values sampled at the first step. We proceed like this until all $n$ variables have been sampled. Importantly, in a Bayesian network over $n$ variables, forward sampling allows us to sample from the joint distribution $\\bfx \\sim p(\\bfx)$ in linear $O(n)$ time by taking exactly 1 multinomial sample from each CPD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier model of a student's grade, we would first sample an exam difficulty $d'$ and an intelligence level $i'$. Then, once we have samples $d'$ and $i'$, we generate a student grade $g'$ from $p(g \\mid d', i')$. At each step, we simply perform standard multinomial sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "A former CS228 student has created an [interactive web simulation](http://pgmlearning.herokuapp.com/samplingApp) for visualizing Bayesian network forward sampling methods. Feel free to play around with it and, if you do, please submit any feedback or bugs through the Feedback button on the web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Forward sampling\" can also be performed efficiently on undirected models if the model can be represented by a clique tree with a small number of variables per node. Calibrate the clique tree, which gives us the marginal distribution over each node, and choose a node to be the root. Then, marginalize over variables in the root node to get the marginal for a single variable. Once the marginal for a single variable $x_1 ∼ p(X_1 \\mid E=e)$ has been sampled from the root node, the newly sampled value $X_1 = x_1$ can be incorporated as evidence. Finish sampling other variables from the same node, each time incorporating the newly sampled nodes as evidence, i.e. $x_2 ∼ p(X_2=x_2 \\mid X_1=x_1,E=e)$ and $x_3 ∼ p(X_3=x_3 \\mid X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,E=e)$ and so on. When moving down the tree to sample variables from other nodes, each node must send an updated message containing the values of the sampled variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "{% include marginfigure.html id=\"rejection\" url=\"assets/img/rejection-sampling.png\" description=\"Graphical illustration of rejection sampling.

This method breaks down if the size of the circle is small relative to the size of the square.\" %}\n",
    "A special case of Monte Carlo integration is rejection sampling. We may use it to compute the area of a region $R$ by sampling in a larger region with a known area and recording the fraction of samples that falls within $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a Bayesian network over the set of variables $X = Z \\cup E$. We may use rejection sampling to compute marginal probabilities $p(E=e)$. We can rewrite the probability as\n",

    "### Importance sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, rejection sampling can be very wasteful. If $p(E=e)$ equals, say, 1%, then we will discard 99% of all samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way of computing such integrals uses *importance sampling*. The main idea is to sample from a distribution $q$ (hopefully with $q(x)$ roughly proportional to $f(x) \\cdot p(x)$), and then *reweigh* the samples in a principled way, so that their sum still approximates the desired integral.\n",
    "\n",

If we can sample from this $q$ (and evaluate the corresponding weight), then we only need a single Monte Carlo sample to compute the true value of our integral. Of course, sampling from such a $q$ is NP-hard in general (its denominator $\\E_{x \\sim p}[\\lvert f(x) \\vert]$ is basically the quantity we're trying to estimate in the first place), but this at least gives us an indication for what to strive for.\n",

    "A key concept in MCMC is that of a *Markov chain*. A (discrete-time) Markov chain is a sequence of random variables $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots$ with each random variable $S_i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,d\\}$ taking one of $d$ possible values, intuitively representing the state of a system. The initial state is distributed according to a probability $P(S_0)$; all subsequent states are generated from a conditional probability distribution that depends only on the previous random state, i.e. $S_i$ is distributed according to $P(S_i \\mid S_{i-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $P(S_i \\mid S_{i-1})$ is the same at every step $i$; this means that the transition probabilities at any time in the entire process depend only on the given state and not on the history of how we got there. This is called the *Markov* assumption.\n",

We will construct below Markov chain with a stationary distribution $\\pi$ that exists and is the same for all $p_0$; we will refer to such $\\pi$ as *the* stationary distribution of the chain.\n",

    "### Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said, the idea of MCMC algorithms is to construct a Markov chain over the assignments to a probability function $p$; the chain will have a stationary distribution equal to $p$ itself; by running the chain for some number of time, we will thus sample from $p$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the acceptance probability encourages us to move towards more likely points in the distribution (imagine for example that $Q$ is uniform); when $Q$ suggests that we move into a low-probability region, we follow that move only a certain fraction of the time.\n",

    "In practice, the distribution $Q$ is taken to be something simple, like a Gaussian centered at $x$ if we are dealing with continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To see that, first observe that if $A(x' \\mid x) < 1$, then $\\frac{P(x)Q(x' \\mid x)}{P(x')Q(x \\mid x')} > 1$ and thus $A(x \\mid x') = 1$. When $A(x' \\mid x) < 1$, this lets us write:\n",

    "A key parameter to this algorithm in the number of burn-in steps $B$. Intuitively, this corresponds to the number of steps needed to converge to our limit (stationary) distribution. This is called the *mixing time* of the Markov chain{% include sidenote.html id=\"note-mixing\" note=\"There is a technical definition of this quantity, which we will not cover here.\" %}. Unfortunately, this time may vary dramatically, and may sometimes take essentially forever. For example, if the transition matrix is\n",

    "then for small $\\e$ it will take a very long time to reach the stationary distribution, which is close to $(0.5, 0.5)$. At each step, we will stay in the same state with overwhelming probability; very rarely, we will transition to another state, and then stay there for a very long time. The average of these states will converge to $(0.5, 0.5)$, but the convergence will be very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem will also occur with complicated distributions that have two distinct and narrow modes; with high probability, the algorithm will sample from a given mode for a very long time. These examples are indications that sampling is a hard problem in general, and MCMC does not give us a free lunch. Nonetheless, for many real-world distributions, sampling will produce very useful solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, perhaps more important problem, is that we may not know when to end the burn-in period, even if it is theoretically not too long. There exist many heuristics to determine whether a Markov chain has *mixed*; however, typically these heuristics involve plotting certain quantities and estimating them by eye; even the quantitative measures are not significantly more reliable than this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, even though MCMC is able to sample from the right distribution (which in turn can be used to solve any inference problem), doing so may sometimes require a very long time, and there is no easy way to judge the amount of computation that we need to spend to find a good solution.\n",
