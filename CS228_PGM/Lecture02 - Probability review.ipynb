    "# 1. Elements of probability\n",
    "In order to define a probability on a set we need a few basic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample space $\\Omega$**: The set of all the outcomes of a random experiment. Here, each outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ can be thought of as a complete description of the state of the real world at the end of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set of events (or event space) $F$**: A set whose elements $A \\in F$ (called events) are subsets of $\\Omega$ (i.e., $A \\subseteq \\Omega$ is a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment)\n",

    "**Probability measure**: A function $P : F \\to \\Re$ that satisfies the following **properties**\n",
    "* $P(A) \\geq 0$, for all $A \\in F$\n",
    "* If $A_1, A_2, \\dotsc$ are disjoint events (i.e. $A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ whenever $i \\neq j$), then $P(\\bigcup_i A_i) = \\sum_i P(A_i)$\n",
    "* $P(\\Omega) = 1$.\n",

    "**Example**: Consider the event of tossing a six-sided die. The sample space is $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. We can define different event spaces on this sample space. For example, the simplest event space is the trivial event space $F = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$. Another event space is the set of all subsets of $\\Omega$. For the first event space, the unique probability measure satisfying the requirements above is given by $P(\\emptyset) = 0$, $P(\\Omega) = 1$. For the second event space, one valid probability measure is to assign the probability of each set in the event space to be $\\frac{i}{6}$ where $i$ is the number of elements of that set; for example, $P(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}) = \\frac{4}{6}$ and $P(\\{1, 2, 3\\}) = \\frac{3}{6}$.\n",

    "Two events are called **independent** if $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$, or equivalently, $P(A \\mid B) = P(A)$. Intuitively, $A$ and $B$ are independent means that observing $B$ does not have any effect on the probability of $A$.\n",

    "# 2. Random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an experiment in which we flip 10 coins, and we want to know the number of coins that come up heads. Here, the elements of the sample space $\\Omega$ are 10-length sequences of heads and tails. For example, we might have $\\omega_0 = \\langle H, H, T, H, T, H, H, T, T, T \\rangle \\in \\Omega$. However, in practice, we usually do not care about the probability of obtaining any particular sequence of heads and tails. Instead we usually care about real-valued functions of outcomes, such as the number of heads that appear among our 10 tosses, or the length of the longest run of tails. These functions, under some technical conditions, are known as **random variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a random variable $X$ is a function $X : \\Omega \\to \\Re$. Typically, we denote random variables using upper case letters $X(\\omega)$ or more simply $X$ (where the dependence on the random outcome $\\omega$ is implied). We denote the value that a random variable may take on using lower case letters $x$. Thus, $X = x$ means that we assign the value $x \\in \\Re$ to the random variable $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: In our experiment above, suppose that $X(\\omega)$ is the number of heads which occur in the sequence of tosses $ω$. Given that only 10 coins are tossed, $X(\\omega)$ can take only a finite number of values, so it is known as a discrete random variable. Here, the probability of the set associated with a random variable $X$ taking on some specific value $k$ is $P(X = k) := P(\\{\\omega : X(\\omega) = k\\})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Suppose that $X(\\omega)$ is a random variable indicating the amount of time it takes for a radioactive particle to decay. In this case, $X(\\omega)$ takes on a infinite number of possible values, so it is called a continuous random variable. We denote the probability that $X$ takes on a value between two real constants $a$ and $b$ (where $a < b$) as $P(a \\leq X \\leq b) := P(\\{\\omega : a \\leq X(\\omega) \\leq b\\})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When describing the event that a random variable takes on a certain value, we often use the **indicator function** $\\mathbf{1}\\{A\\}$ which takes value 1 when event $A$ happens and 0 otherwise. For example, for a random variable $X$,\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to specify the probability measures used when dealing with random variables, it is often convenient to specify alternative functions (CDFs, PDFs, and PMFs) from which the probability measure governing an experiment immediately follows. In this section and the next two sections, we describe each of these types of functions in turn. A **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) is a function $F_X : \\Re \\to [0, 1]$ which specifies a probability measure as\n",

    "## 2.2 Probability mass functions\n",
    "When a random variable $X$ takes on a finite set of possible values (i.e., $X$ is a discrete random variable), a simpler way to represent the probability measure associated with a random variable is to directly specify the probability of each value that the random variable can assume.

But it should be emphasized that the value of PDF at any given point $x$ is not the probability of that event, i.e., $f_X(x) \\neq P(X = x)$. For example, $f_X(x)$ can take on values larger than one (but the integral of $f_X(x)$ over any subset of $\\Re$ will be at most one).\n",
