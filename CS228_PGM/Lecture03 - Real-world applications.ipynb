    "## Probabilistic Models of Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a distribution $p(\\bfx)$ over images, where $\\bfx$ is an image represented as a vector of pixels, that assigns high probability to images that look realistic and low probability to everything else. Given such a model, we can solve a wide array of interesting tasks.\n",

    "### Image Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Radford et al.](../images/https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) trained a probabilistic model $ p(\\bfx) $ that assigns high probability to images that look like bedrooms. To do so, they trained their model on a dataset of bedroom images, a sample of which is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Data**<br />\n",
    "![bedroom1](../images/bedroominpainting1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this probabilistic model of bedrooms, we can now _**generate**_ new realistic bedroom images by sampling from this distribution. Specifically, new sampled images $\\hat{\\bfx} \\sim p(\\bfx)$ are created directly from our model $p(\\bfx)$, which can now generate data similar to the bedroom images that we trained it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, one of the reasons why generative models are powerful lie in the fact that they have many fewer parameters than the amount of data that they are trained with --- as a result, the models have to efficiently distill the essence of the training data to be able to generate new samples. We see that our particular probabilistic model of bedrooms has done a good job of capturing the data's essence, and can therefore produce highly realistic images, some examples of which are shown below:\n",

    "Similarly, we can learn a model for faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "![faces1](../images/progressiveGAN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the bedroom images, these faces are completely synthetic --- these images are not of an actual person.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same approach can be used for other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "![faces1](../images/pnpgan.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the images are not perfect and may need to be refined; however, sampling generates images that are very similar to what one might expect.\n",

    "### In-Painting\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same $p(\\bfx)$ for faces as before, we can also \"fill in\" the rest of an image. For example, given $p(\\bfx)$ and a patch of an existing image (e.g., a piece of a photograph), we can sample from $p(\\textsf{image} \\mid \\textsf{patch})$ and generate different possible ways of completing the image:\n",

    "### Image Denoising\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, given an image corrupted by noise (e.g., an old photograph), we can attempt to restore it based on our probabilistic model of what images look like. Specifically, we want to generate a graphical model that does a good job at modeling the posterior distribution $p(\\textsf{original image} \\mid \\textsf{noisy image}).$ Then, by observing the noisy image, we can sample or use exact inference to predict the original image.\n",

    "Knowing the probability distribution can also help us model natural language utterances. In this case, we want to construct a probability distribution $p(x)$ over sequences of words or characters $x$ that assigns high probability to proper (English) sentences. This distribution can be learned from a variety of sources, such as Wikipedia articles.\n",

I.e., if you send a message over a channel, you might get something different on the other end due to noise.
