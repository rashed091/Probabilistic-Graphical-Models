    "One type of layer in a CNN is the convolutional layer. These involve taking taking filter kernels and convolving them over the image. This has the effect of filtering an image and preserves\n",

    "applied to multiple parts of the same image to greatly reduce the model's complexity. This process creates a feature map from the responses for each filter, which can be fed into a pooling layer.\n",
    "The pooling layer helps to reduce the dimensionality of the input space by downsampling the feature maps at each layer. For example, max pooling with a kernel size of 2x2\n",

    "# Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention mechanisms are techniques that are used to focus on particular features in the data. They has been show to drastically improve performance in tasks such as machine translation, image captioning and speech recognition. They allow to accomodate for long-range dependencies, and dealing with the problem of vanishing gradients, seen in RNNs. By allowing for fine-grained localized representations of portions of data, like patches in images or words in sentences, attention improves feature recognition in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention Computation \n",
    "\n",
    "Attention can be computed for a machine translation task using the following procedure: \n",
    "* Encode each token in the input sentence into a key vector.\n",
    "* When decoding, compare the query vector with the encoder states, and generate alignment scores corresponding to each key vector.\n",
    "* Compute the attention weights by normalizing the alignment scores.\n",
    "* Treat the encoder states as value vectors and compute a weighted sum, using the attention weights.\n",
    "* Use this weighted sum in the decoder to generate the next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attention Variants\n",
    "There are a number of different alignment score functions that may be used to generate scores. Some of these are shown in the table below:\n",

    "Soft and hard attention are variants of attention that respectively use deterministic and stochastic methods in computing the weights for each token. The computation described above is for soft attention. Instead of using the attention weights to compute a weighted average, hard attention uses these as probabilities and samples from the corresponding features using this distribution. A comparison for attention used on images can be illustrated below. Notice how soft attention can be diffuse, and assign nonzero weights to significant weights to large portions of the image at times, while hard attention focuses on a particular equally-sized part of the image in each case. Soft attention is presently the more popular variant, primarily because it allows for simpler backpropagation in the network.\n",

    "## Applications in Computer Vision\n",
    "Attention can be used in conjunction with conventional CNNs in image processing. Features extracted from the CNN are used as key vectors and attention is used to sequentialy compute the caption as tokens. It can also be used in image paragraph generation, which is the generation of a long paragraph to describe an image. This is a challenging task because it involves long-term reasoning about language and visual features. Each sentence needs to be grounded on visual features to ensure contentful descriptions. One technique for doing this, presented in Xu et al. (2017) <d-cite key=\"paragraphGAN\"></d-cite>, proceeds as follow:\n",
    "* The image is first segmented into semantic regions, and each region is locally captioned with phrases\n",
    "* Attention is applied on the visual regions and the text phrases and the resulting features fed to a generator which generates sentences\n",
    "* These sentences are then fed to a sentence discriminator and a recurrent topic-transition discriminator for assessing sentence plausibility and topic coherence respectively\n",

    "dependencies over sequences while also improving training and inference speed.\n",

    "### Unsupervised Language Model Pre-training\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, language representation via unsupervised language model pre-training has revolutionized the field of natural language processing.\n",
    "Parameters learned during the training of large language models using self-supervision have been shown to be extremely effective when transferred to other NLP prediction tasks. <d-cite key=\"ulmfit,gpt,elmo,bert,gpt2\"></d-cite>\n",
    "Since language modeling requires the resolving of long-term dependencies, hierarchical relations, and sentiment, it can be seen as an ideal source task for transfer learning in NLP. <d-cite key=\"ulmfit\"></d-cite>\n",
    "\n",
    "ELMo <d-cite key=\"elmo\"></d-cite> introduce deep contextualized word representations, which are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional LSTM language model trained to predict both the next word in a sentence given its history and the previous word in a sentence given its future words.\n",
    "These contextualized representations can then be frozen and used as embeddings for other downstream tasks like question answering, textual entailment, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "Instead of just transferring word embeddings for a new task, Howard and Ruder's (2018) ULMFiT aims to transfer the language model itself for new tasks.\n",
    "Particularly, the authors train an AWD-LSTM <d-cite key=\"awdlstm\"></d-cite> language model on 103 million words of Wikipedia data, fine-tune on a smaller amount of task-specific data using different learning rates for different layers of the model, and add a final classifier on the end of the network for the target task.\n",
    "Thus, while ELMo requires task-specific architectures when transferring to new tasks, ULMFiT simply adds a classifier on top of the language model to obtain state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks.\n",
    "OpenAI then adapted this method (dubbed Generative Pre-training or GPT) to work with the popular Transformer <d-cite key=\"transformer\"></d-cite> architecture, an auxiliary language modeling loss during fine-tuning to obtain even better results, and adaptation to more difficult tasks such as machine translation. <d-cite key=\"gpt\"></d-cite>\n",
    "Just this year, OpenAI followed up their work with GPT2, which is the highest performing language model to date.\n",
    "They use a similar but much higher capacity model to GPT as they find that capacity improves performance log-linearly.\n",

    "The paper introduces two new objectives to adapt the traditional task of predicting the next word in language modeling to benefit from bidirectionality.\n",
    "After encoding each word in a given sentence into a contextualized representation, they have the model both predict a random masked word from the original sentence and perform a binary classification on two sentences to identify whether or not one sentence follows the other.\n",
    "Although the masked language model objective requires more pre-training steps since each prediction is no longer sequential, they find that performance increases over the traditional objective are immediate.\n",

    "An ablation study on model size empirically shows that extreme model sizes lead to large improvements on even very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained.\n",
