    "# Introduction to Learning Probabilistic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical models are a powerful mechanism for capturing structure in distributions that enables efficient inference. We're now ready to talk about how to choose such models. This is the problem of *model selection*. Invariably, domain knowledge guides aspects of the model we choose– for example, the underlying physics, biology, economics, et cetera. However, in practice, some aspects of the model must often be learned directly from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now let's turn our attention to how to learn models. We'll begin with a discussion of a rather general framework of learning based on the time-honored principle of *maximum likelihood*. We will then put it to work to help us learn a wide range of tree-structured graphical models, including hidden Markov models and what are referred to as naive Bayes models– which, despite their name, are surprisingly powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll show how to efficiently learn the conditional distribution tables that characterize a tree model. This is called *parameter estimation*. And we will see that the concept of empirical distributions or histograms plays an important role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will show how to solve the problem of finding a tree that best fits the data, which is referred to as *structure learning*. Amazingly, even though there are a super exponential number of possible trees, we will see how to solve the problem with only quadratic search complexity using the celebrated Chow-Liu algorithm, which is based on measuring empirical mutual information. Exciting applications for the learning methodology we develop are everywhere, from natural language processing and automatic face recognition to phylogenetics and well beyond. So let's begin. "

    "Thus far in the course, we've been given a probabilistic model of the uncertain world, from which we produced predictions given observations. But where do these probabilistic models come from? We now turn to the problem of learning such models (also referred to as model selection since we are selecting which model to use).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example that we'll build on later in this section: We don't actually know the underlying probability distribution for what makes an email considered spam vs. “ham\" (i.e., not spam). However, we do have access to plenty of training examples of what emails are spam or ham, where a user has manually flagged her or his incoming emails as spam or not. From all these training examples, we could learn a model for what spam emails look like and what ham emails look like.\n",

    "There are two levels of learning we consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter learning**: Suppose we know what the edges are in an undirected graphical model but we don't know what the table entries should be for the potentials – how do we estimate these entries?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure learning**: What if we know neither the parameters nor which edges are present in an undirected graphical model? In this case, we could first figure out what edges are present. After we decide on which edges are present, then the problem reduces to the first problem of parameter learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the high-level setup is the same: there is some underlying probability distribution $p$ that we don't know details for but want to learn. The distribution $p$ has some parameter (or a set of parameters) $\\theta$. We will assume that we can collect $n$ independent samples $X^{(1)}, \\dots , X^{(n)}$ from the distribution (these samples are often referred to as “training data\"). Given these samples, we aim to estimate $\\theta$ using what's called “maximum likelihood\", which tries to learn a model that in some sense best fits the training data we have available. Along the way, we will see how information theory plays a crucial role in helping us not only develop computer programs to learn probability distributions but it also provides an interpretation of what the programs are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with *parameter learning*, starting with a single node graphical model and working our way to richer graphical models whose potential table entries we aim to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single node undirected graphical model corresponding to a single finite random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A graphical model called the naive Bayes model which can be used for tasks like email spam detection and handwritten digit recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General tree-structured undirected graphical models \n",
    "\n",
    "We then turn toward *structure learning*, proceeding directly to the most general class of graphical models we consider: tree-structured undirected graphical models, where we learn which edges to include in the tree and what potential tables to assign to the edges. "

The semi-colon is used to say that everything after the semi-colon in the parentheses refers to parameter(s) of the model. The probability that $X=x$ is denoted as $p_{X}(x;\\theta )$.\n",

    "Let the likelihood function be considered fixed; the likelihood function is usually well-determined from a statement of the data-generating process. It is clear that different choices of the prior distribution $p(\\theta)$ may make the integral more or less difficult to calculate, and the product $p(x\\mid\\theta)\\times p(\\theta)$ may take one algebraic form or another. For certain choices of the prior, the posterior has the same algebraic form as the prior (generally with different parameter values). Such a choice is a conjugate prior.\n",

    "# III— Structure learning for an Undirected Tree-Structured Graphical Model: The Chow-Liu Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we've covered parameter learning for undirected trees, where we assume we know the tree structure. But what if we don't know what tree to even use? We now look at an algorithm called the Chow-Liu algorithm that learns which tree to use from training data, again using maximum likelihood. Once more, information measures appear, where mutual information plays a pivotal role. Recall that mutual information tells us how far two random variables are from being independent. A key idea here is that to determine whether an edge between two random variables should be present in a graphical model, we can look at mutual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note (November 14, 2016): While the Chow-Liu algorithm is quite simple to describe, the running time and correctness of Chow-Liu is a bit more involved than other algorithms we have encountered so far. I will post a little bit about this later this week. For those who want the gory details now, look up Kruskal's algorithm. Chow-Liu basically does a preprocessing step (computing empirical mutual information quantities) before just running Kruskal's algorithm; what gets a bit messy is talking about how to efficiently check for whether adding an edge creates a cycle, and also the proof of correctness for the algorithm uses a graph induction. These details are beyond the scope of the course but, again, I'll post something about it later this week for those who are interested. \n",
