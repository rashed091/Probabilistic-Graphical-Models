# ProbabilisticGraphicalModels_Intro

Course *Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models* taught at *Telecom Paristech* by **[Pr. Umut Simsekli](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/simsekli/)** (2019 version) in the context of the Msc data-science, a Master delivered by *Ecole Polytechnique* as part of the **[NewUni](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/06/28/france-considers-plan-create-university-mit)** groupment of universities.

This course addresses the following topics:
- Hidden Markov Models (Modelisation, Forward-Backward algorithms in theory & practice)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (Clustering, Expectation-Maximization algorithms in theory & practice)

In this repository, you will find 3 projects:
- Lab1: Simulation of a moving robot, the position of which is probabilistic, and not always known to the user... Knowing the probability model and a set of observations, how can we find the most likely-position at any time ? Using Hidden Markov Models!
- Lab2: the Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algortihm from scratch. Mathematical theory and code implementation.
- Lab3: Based on a [research paper by Ali Taylan Cemgil](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2009/785152/), mathematical justification and code implementation of a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization algorithm based on a bayesian inference EM-algorithm. It is tested on a set of 400 images in order to create a **base of face vectors**.
