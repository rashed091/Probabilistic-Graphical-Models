    "<p>While there are many potential themes of probabilistic models we might explore, we'll herein focus on two: <strong>generative vs. discriminative models</strong>, and <strong>\"fully Bayesian\" vs. \"lowly point estimate\" learning</strong>. We will stick to the supervised setting as well.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, our pool ring is not a godhead — we are not nautical missionaries brandishing a divine statistical truth, demanding that each model we encounter implement this truth in a rigid, bottom-up fashion. Instead, we'll explore the unique goals, formulations and shortcomings of each, and fall back on Bayes' theorem to bridge the gaps between. Without it, we'd quickly start sinking.</p>\n",
    "<h1>Discriminative vs. generative models</h1>\n",
    "<p>The goal of a supervised model is to compute the distribution over outcomes <span class=\"math\">\\(y\\)</span> given an input <span class=\"math\">\\(x\\)</span>, written <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y\\vert x)\\)</span>. If <span class=\"math\">\\(y\\)</span> is discrete, this distribution is a probability mass function, e.g. a multinomial or binomial distribution. If continuous, it is a probability density function, e.g. a Gaussian distribution.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Discriminative models</h2>\n",
    "<p>In discriminative models, we immediately direct our focus to this output distribution. Taking an example from the <a href=\"https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2017/05/18/minimizing_the_negative_log_likelihood_in_english/\">previous post</a>, let's assume a softmax regression which receives some data <span class=\"math\">\\(x\\)</span> and predicts a multi-class label <code>red or green or blue</code>. The model's output distribution is therefore multinomial; a multinomial distribution requires as a parameter a vector <span class=\"math\">\\(\\pi\\)</span> of respective outcome probabilities, e.g. <code>{red: .27, green: .11, blue: .62}</code>. We can compute these individual probabilities via the softmax function, where:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><span class=\"math\">\\(\\pi_k = \\frac{e^{\\eta_k}}{\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^K e^{\\eta_k}}\\)</span></li>\n",
    "<li><span class=\"math\">\\(\\eta_k = \\theta_k^Tx\\)</span></li>\n",
    "<li><span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> is a matrix of weights which we must infer, and <span class=\"math\">\\(x\\)</span> is our input.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3>Inference</h3>\n",
    "<p>Typically, we perform inference by taking the <em>maximum likelihood estimate</em>: \"which parameters <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> most likely gave rise to the observed data pairs <span class=\"math\">\\(D = ((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}), ..., (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)}))\\)</span> via the relationships described above?\" We compute this estimate by maximizing the log-likelihood function with respect to <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span>, or equivalently minimizing the negative log-likelihood in identical fashion — the latter better known as a \"loss function\" in machine learning parlance.</p>\n",
    "<p>Unfortunately, the maximum likelihood estimate includes no information about the plausibility of the chosen parameter value itself. As such, we often place a <em>prior</em> on our parameter and take the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arg_max\">\"argmax\"</a> over their product. This gives the <em>maximum a posteriori</em> estimate, or MAP.</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"math\">$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\theta_{MAP}\n",
    "&= \\underset{\\theta}{\\arg\\max}\\ \\log \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{m} P(y^{(i)}\\vert x^{(i)}; \\theta)P(\\theta)\\\\\n",
    "&= \\underset{\\theta}{\\arg\\max}\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} \\log{P(y^{(i)}\\vert x^{(i)}; \\theta)} + \\log{P(\\theta)}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$</div>\n",
    "<p>The <span class=\"math\">\\(\\log{P(\\theta)}\\)</span> term can be easily rearranged into what is better known as a <em>regularization term</em> in machine learning, where the type of prior distribution we place on <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> gives the type of regularization term.</p>\n",
    "<p>The argmax finds the point(s) <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> at which the given function attains its maximum value. As such, the typical discriminative model — softmax regression, logistic regression, linear regression, etc. — returns a single, lowly point estimate for the parameter in question.</p>\n",
    "<h3>How do we compute this value?</h3>\n",
    "<p>In the trivial case where <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> is 1-dimensional, we can take the derivative of the function in question with respect to <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span>, set it equal to 0, then solve for <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span>. (Additionally, in order to verify that we have indeed obtained a maximum, we should compute a second derivative and assert that its value is negative.)</p>\n",
    "<p>In the more realistic case where <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> is a high-dimensional vector or matrix, we can compute the argmax by way of an optimization routine like stochastic gradient ascent or, as is more common, the argmin by way of stochastic gradient descent.</p>\n",
    "<h3>What if we're uncertain about our parameter estimates?</h3>\n",
    "<p>Consider the following three scenarios — taken from Daphne Koller's <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-3-learning/home/welcome\">Learning in Probabilistic Graphical Models</a>.</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "<p>Two teams play 10 times, and the first wins 7 of the 10 matches.</p>\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>&gt; <em>Infer that the probability of the first team winning is 0.7.</em></p>\n",
    "<p>Seems reasonable, right?</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "<p>A coin is tossed 10 times, and comes out <code>heads</code> on 7 of the 10 tosses.</p>\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>&gt; <em>Infer that the probability of observing <code>heads</code> is 0.7.</em></p>\n",
    "<p>Changing only the analogy, this now seems wholly unreasonable — right?</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "<p>A coin is tossed 10000 times, and comes out <code>heads</code> on 7000 of the 10000 tosses.</p>\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>&gt; <em>Infer that the probability of observing <code>heads</code> is 0.7.</em></p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, increasing the observed counts, the previous scenario now seems plausible.</p>\n",
    "<p>I find this a terrific succession of examples with which to convey the notion of <em>uncertainty</em> — that the more data we have, the less uncertain we are about what's really going on. This notion is at the heart of Bayesian statistics and is extremely intuitive to us as humans. Unfortunately, when we compute \"lowly point estimates,\" i.e. the argmin of the loss function with respect to our parameters <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span>, we are discarding this uncertainty entirely. Should our model be fit with <span class=\"math\">\\(n\\)</span> observations where <span class=\"math\">\\(n\\)</span> is not a large number, our estimate would amount to that of Example #2: <em>a coin is tossed <span class=\"math\">\\(n\\)</span> times, and comes out <code>heads</code> on <code>int(.7n)</code> of <code>n</code> tosses — infer that the probability of observing <code>heads</code> is squarely, unflinchingly, <code>0.7</code>.</em></p>\n",
    "<h3>What does including uncertainty look like?</h3>\n",
    "<p>It looks like a <em>distribution</em> — a range of possible values for <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span>. Further, these values are of varying plausibility as dictated by the data we've observed. In Example #2, while we'd still say that <span class=\"math\">\\(\\Pr(\\text{heads}) = .7\\)</span> is the parameter value <em>most likely</em> to have generated our data, we'd additionally maintain that other values in <span class=\"math\">\\((0, 1)\\)</span> are plausible, albeit less so, as well. Again, this logic should be simple to grasp: it comes easy to us as humans.</p>\n",
    "<h3>Prediction</h3>\n",
    "<p>With the parameter <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> in hand prediction is simple: just plug back into our original function <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y\\vert x)\\)</span>. With a point estimate for <span class=\"math\">\\(\\theta\\)</span>, we compute but a single value for <span class=\"math\">\\(y\\)</span>.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Generative models</h2>\n",
    "<p>In generative models, we instead compute <em>component parts</em> of the desired output distribution <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y\\vert x)\\)</span> instead of directly computing <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y\\vert x)\\)</span> itself. To examine these parts, we'll turn to Bayes' theorem:</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"math\">$$\n",
    "P(y\\vert x) = \\frac{P(x\\vert y)P(y)}{P(x)}\n",
    "$$</div>\n",
    "<p>The numerator posits a generative mechanism for the observed data pairs <span class=\"math\">\\(D = ((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}), ..., (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)}))\\)</span> in idiomatic terms; it states that each pair was generated by:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Selecting a label <span class=\"math\">\\(y^{(i)}\\)</span> from <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y)\\)</span>. If our model is predicting <code>red or green or blue</code>, <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y)\\)</span> is likely a multinomial distribution.<ul>\n",
    "<li>If our observed label counts are <code>{'red': 20, 'green': 50, 'blue': 30}</code>, we would retrodictively believe this multinomial distribution to have had a parameter vector near <span class=\"math\">\\(\\pi = [.2, .5, .3]\\)</span>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>Given a label <span class=\"math\">\\(y^{(i)}\\)</span>, select a value <span class=\"math\">\\(x^{(i)}\\)</span> from <span class=\"math\">\\(P(x\\vert y)\\)</span>. Trivially, this means that we are positing <em>three distinct distributions</em> of this form: <span class=\"math\">\\(P(x\\vert y=\\text{red}), P(x\\vert y=\\text{green}), P(x\\vert y=\\text{blue})\\)</span>.<ul>\n",
    "<li>For example, if <span class=\"math\">\\(y^{(i)} = \\text{red}\\)</span>, draw <span class=\"math\">\\(x^{(i)}\\)</span> from <span class=\"math\">\\(P(x\\vert y=\\text{red})\\)</span>, and so forth.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<h3>Inference</h3>\n",
    "<p>The inference task is to compute <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y)\\)</span> and each distinct <span class=\"math\">\\(P(x\\vert y_k)\\)</span>. In a classification setting, the former is likely a multinomial distribution. The latter might be a multinomial distribution or a set of binomial distributions in the case of discrete-feature data, or a set of Gaussian distributions in the case of continuous-feature data. In fact, these distributions can be whatever you'd like, dictated by the idiosyncrasies of the problem at hand.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, we can compute these distributions as per normal: via a maximum likelihood estimate, a MAP estimate, etc.</p>\n",
    "<h3>Prediction</h3>\n",
    "<p>To compute <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y\\vert x)\\)</span> we return to Bayes' theorem:</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"math\">$$\n",
    "P(y\\vert x) = \\frac{P(x\\vert y)P(y)}{P(x)}\n",
    "$$</div>\n",
    "<p>We have the numerator <span class=\"math\">\\(P(y)\\)</span> and three distinct conditional distributions <span class=\"math\">\\(P(x\\vert y=\\text{red}), P(x\\vert y=\\text{green})\\)</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\(P(x\\vert y=\\text{blue})\\)</span> in hand. What about the denominator?</p>\n",
    "<h3>Conditional probability and marginalization</h3>\n",
    "<p>The axiom of conditional probability allows us to write <span class=\"math\">\\(P(B\\vert A)P(A) = P(B, A)\\)</span>, i.e. the <em>joint probability</em> of <span class=\"math\">\\(B\\)</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\(A\\)</span>. This is a simple algebraic manipulation. As such, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem in its more compact form.</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"math\">$$\n",
    "P(y\\vert x) = \\frac{P(x, y)}{P(x)}\n",
    "$$</div>\n",
    "<p>Another manipulation of probability distributions is the <em>marginalization</em> operator, which allows us to write:</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"math\">$$\n",
    "\\int P(x, y)dy = P(x)\n",
    "$$</div>\n",
    "<p>As such, we can <em>marginalize <span class=\"math\">\\(y\\)</span> out of the numerator</em> so as to obtain the denominator we require. This denominator is often called the \"evidence.\"</p>\n",
    "<h3>Marginalization example</h3>\n",
    "<p>Marginalization took me a while to understand. Imagine we have the following joint probability distribution out of which we'd like to marginalize <span class=\"math\">\\(A\\)</span>.</p>\n",
