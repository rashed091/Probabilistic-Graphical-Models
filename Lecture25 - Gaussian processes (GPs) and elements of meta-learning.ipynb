    "## Learning Functions from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of data points, we often want to learn a function that describes the data. One approach is to guess the parametric form of a function that could fit the data. Forms we might guess include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Linear function of $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbb{x}$: $f(\\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbb{x}$</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Linear function of $\\mathbf{w}$: $f(\\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{w}^T\\phi(\\mathbb{x})$  where $\\phi(\\mathbb{x})$ is a vector basic function, i.e. $\\phi(\\mathbb{x}) = (1, \\mathbb{x}, \\mathbb{x}^2)$</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Non-linear function of $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbb{x}$: $f(\\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbb{g} (\\mathbf{w}^T\\phi(\\mathbb{x}))$, i.e. Neural Network </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "We then choose an error measure and minimize with respect to $\\mathbf{w}$: $E(\\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[f(\\mathbb{x_i}, \\mathbf{w}) - y(\\mathbb{x_i}) \\right]^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can explicitly account for noise in our model by introducting a noise function $\\epsilon(x)$: $y(\\mathbb{x}) = f(\\mathbb(x), \\mathbf{w}) + \\epsilon(\\mathbb{x})$\n",
    "\n",
    "We commonly use i.d.d. additive Gaussian noise, where we take $\\epsilon(x) = \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. Then, we aim to maximize the likelihood of the data $p(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}, \\sigma^2)$ with respect to $\\sigma^2$, $\\mathbf{w}$. The model and likelihood are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Observation Model: $p(y(\\mathbb{x}) | \\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}, \\sigma^2) = \\mathcal{N}(y(\\mathbb{x}); f(\\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}), \\sigma^2)$ </li>\n",
    "<li> Likelihood: $p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^N \\mathcal{N}(y(\\mathbb{x_i}); f(\\mathbb{x_i}, \\mathbf{w}), \\sigma^2)$ </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularlization**\n",
    "\n",
    "This probabilistic approach helps us interpret the error measure in a deterministic way and gives a sense of the noise level $\\sigma^2$. Thus, probabilistic methods provide an intuitive framework for representing uncertainty and model development. However, these approaches are prone to *overfitting* for flexible $f(\\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w})$. They achieve low error on the training data, but high error on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to reduce overfitting is to use *regularization*. We can introdcuce a complexity penality to the log-likelihood or error function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\log p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbb{x}, \\mathbf{w}) \\propto -\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n(f(\\mathbb{x_i}, \\mathbf{w}) - y(\\mathbb{x_i})^2) - \\lambda \\mathbb{w}^T\\mathbb{w}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this introduces new questions: how do we define complexity? and how much should we penalize complexity? In practice, we control the penalty by setting  $\\lambda$ using cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe our data and models using Bayes' Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{posterior} = \\frac{\\textrm{likelihood} * \\textrm{prior}}{\\textrm{marginal\\ likelihood}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(\\mathbf{w} \\mid \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbb{X}, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{p(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbb{X}, \\mathbf{w}, \\sigma^2)p(\\mathbf{w})}{p(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbb{X}, \\sigma^2)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions over a test case, we can obtain a predictive distribution by marginalizing out $\\mathbf{w}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(y \\mid x_{*}, \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbb{X}) = \\int p(y \\mid x_{*}, \\mathbf{w}) p(\\mathbf{w} \\mid \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbb{X}) d \\mathbf{w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this predictive distribution, we average over infinitely many models weighted by their posterior probabilities. There is no over-fitting, and complexity is automatically calibrated. This approach is useful because we are typically more interested in distributions over functions than in parameters $\\mathbf{w}$.\n",

    "**Comparison to parametric models**\n",
    "\n",
    "In parametric models, we assume that all data can be represented using a fixed, finite number of parameters. (e.g. Mixture of K Gaussians, polynomial regression, neural networks). In nonparametric models, the number of parameters can grow with the sample size. The number of parameters may be random (e.g. kernel density estimation). In Bayesian nonparametrics, we allow for an infinite number of parameters a prior. Models of finite datasets will have only finite number of parameters; other parameters are integrated out. We can compare parametric Bayesian inference with nonparametric Bayesian inference:\n",

    "* Inference can be done fully analytically (in case of Gaussian likelihood)\n",
    "* Inference and learning are very computationally costly since exact methods require inversion of large matrices\n",
    "* There is a variety of approximation methods to GPs that can bring down the learning and inference cost to $O(n)$ and $O(1)$, respectively\n",
    "* Many new libraries based on Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras -- despite computational constraints, GPs are certainly quite popoular\n",

    "## Meta-learning and Neural Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we assume that data was generated by a single function. What if there are multiple data-generating functions, and each time we get only a few points from one of them. Can we identify it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of meta-learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard learning, given a distribution over examples (single task), we learn a function that minimizes the loss $\\hat \\phi = \\arg\\min_{\\phi} E_{z \\sim D}[l(f_{\\phi}(z))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "In learning-to-learn, given a distribution over tasks, output an adaptation rule that can be used at test time to generalize from a task description: $\\hat \\theta = \\arg\\min_{\\theta} E_{T \\sim P}[L_T(g_{\\theta}(T))]$ where $L_T(g_{\\theta}(T)) \\coloneqq E_{z \\sim D}[l(f_{\\phi}(z))]$, $\\phi \\coloneqq g_{\\theta}(T)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Few-shot image classification: multiple datasets, each of which includes a few examples of each class.\n",
    "* Few-shot user-specific recommendation: recommend twitter posts to users; each user has different set of likes and dislikes (binary prediction)\n",
    "* Contextual interpretability: interpretable linear model conditioned on images\n",
    "* One-shot imitation learning: imitate a single behaviour from demonstrations; give a new demonstration, produce a policy to quickly imitate the demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Neural Processes**\n",
    "Try to produce representations for observable inputs and labels, $r$. The representations are aggregated and fed to function $g$ for prediction. So we can produce different function $g$'s given different sets of training data. This is similar to Gaussian Processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attentive Neural Processes**\n",
    "Incorporates attention mechanism into neural processes. Instead of using MLP, use attention to attend to differnt parts of contexts. Proposed based on the observation that neural processes tend to under-fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "* There are cases when learning a single function is not enough -- contextual models are used in such cases\n",
    "* Few-shot learning is a popular application of meta-learning, where contextual models are trained on distributions of different tasks. Examples include solving different sub-problems, imitating different demonstrations, and making predictions about different user preferences\n",
    "* Neural processes propose an alternative to kernel learning (kernel becomes fully implicity; the model is scalable without approximations)\n"
