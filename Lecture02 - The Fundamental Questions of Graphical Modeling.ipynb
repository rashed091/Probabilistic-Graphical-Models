    "\n",
    "With this structure, we can better express the joint probabilities among the RVs than with a full joint distribution table. The Factorization Law gives us a way to do so.\n",
    "The Factorization Law is a graph traversal algorithm that outputs a unique representation of the joint probability of the RVs. Concisely, we traverse the graph and identify the conditional probabilities of each node given its parent nodes and the marginal probabilities of nodes that do not have parents, then multiply all terms together for the joint probability of all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main benefits of representing the joint distribution in this manner (with a graph structure and conditional probabilities that tie parent nodes and child nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Main Benefits of Graphical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The first benefit is the cost savings in representing the joint distribution.\n",
    "By modeling the dependencies among the RVs with a graph and conditionals, the number of parameters needed to describe the joint distribution is much fewer than when using a full joint distribution table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume all RVs are binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<d-math block>\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  P(X_{1}) &\\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{parameter} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{2}) &\\rightarrow 1\\ \\text{parameter} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{3} \\mid X_{1}) &\\rightarrow 2\\ \\text{parameters} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{4} \\mid X_{2}) &\\rightarrow 2\\ \\text{parameters} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{5} \\mid X_{2}) &\\rightarrow 2\\ \\text{parameters} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{6} \\mid X_{3}, X_{4}) &\\rightarrow 4\\ \\text{parameters} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{7} \\mid X_{6}) &\\rightarrow 2\\ \\text{parameters} \\\\\n",
    "  P(X_{8} \\mid X_{5}, X_{6}) &\\rightarrow 4\\ \\text{parameters} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "</d-math>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have a total of 18 parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, with a full joint distribution table, we would need $2^{8}-1$ parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second benefit is data integration.\n",
    "By factoring the joint distribution into modular terms, each term becomes self-contained and we can estimate each term with only the relevant data points (e.g. to estimate $P(X_{8}|X_{5}, X_{6})$ we only need data for $X_{8}, X_{5}, X_{6}$).\n",
    "Therefore, the problem of joint distribution estimation can be modularized into smaller pieces and integrated later by multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Cell molecules example\n",
    "  - One lab can study the subtree formed by $X_{1}, X_{3}, X_{6}, X_{7}, X_{8}$ while another lab can study $X_{2}, X_{4}, X_{5}$, then fuse their estimations together by multiplying the terms by their dependencies.\n",
    "- Cellphone usage\n",
    "  - We can separately study the distribution represented by the user's text, image and network data and fuse them together with a graphic model to derive the joint distribution.\n",
    "- Genomics/biology\n",
    "  - We routinely combine various data together with graphical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, graphical models provide a generic method of representing knowledge and making inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encode our domain knowledge through priors and incorporate them into our inference via the Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "<d-math block center>\n",
    "  \\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "    p(h|d) &=& \\frac{p(d|h)p(h)}{p(d)} \\\\\n",
    "    p(h|d) &=& \\text{  posterior} \\\\\n",
    "    p(d|h) &=& \\text{  likelihood} \\\\\n",
    "    p(h) &=& \\text{  prior} \\\\\n",
    "    p(d) &=& \\text{  marginal probability of the data}=\\int_{H}p(d|h)p(h)dh \\\\\n",
    "  \\end{array}\n",
    "</d-math>\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical model provides a structured and efficient way for doing these computations.\n",
    "Therefore, a graphical model along with the Bayes Theorem provide a universal way of representing knowledge and computation.\n"

    "By contrast, the Markov random field uses an undirected graph.\n",

    "### Why should we study graphical models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and analysis of algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, etc. encounter issues like uncertainty and complexity. In graphical models, we use the idea of modularity, and view such complex problems as combinations of simpler parts. Tools from graphical models can be used for communication of information in networks. They can also be used to ease computation (simplify computational complexities and reduce time required for computations). As such, graphical model formalism can be used for development of efficient software packages for decision making and learning in problems rely on huge datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we mention a few prominent reasons why one can use probabilistic graphical models:\n",
    "<ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">\n",
    "  <li>In graphical models, we break tasks into combinations of simpler parts. Probability theory helps to connect these simple parts with each other in a coherent and consistent manner.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li>Graph theory gives an easy-to-understand interface in which models with multiple variables can be cast. Such interfaces help to uncover interactions, dependencies between difference sets of variables. As a consequence, graph theory also helps in the design of more efficient algorithms.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <li>Formalisms in general graphical model can be used for tasks in a plethora of fields like information theory, cyber security, systems engineering, pattern recognition etc.</li>\n",

    "  <li>The generality of graphical model frameworks gives us a way to view different systems as occurrences of a common underlying formalism.</li>\n",
